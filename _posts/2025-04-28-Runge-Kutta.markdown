# Solution of First Order Differential Equation using Runge-Kutta Method

The numerical solution of **first-order differential equations** plays a crucial role across science and engineering. While many analytical methods exist, they are often limited to relatively simple equations. As a result, numerical methods have become indispensable tools for approximating solutions.

Several methods are available for numerically solving first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs):

- **Eulerâ€™s Method**: The simplest method, based on a first-order Taylor expansion. It is easy to implement but often suffers from large truncation errors, especially over larger step sizes.
- **Improved Eulerâ€™s Method (Heunâ€™s Method)**: An enhancement over Eulerâ€™s method, reducing errors by using an averaged slope.
- **Taylor Series Methods**: These methods provide high accuracy but require the calculation of higher-order derivatives, making them computationally intensive.
- **Runge-Kutta Methods**: A family of iterative methods that achieve higher accuracy without requiring higher derivatives. They are the most widely used in practice due to their balance between simplicity, accuracy, and computational efficiency.

Among these, the **Runge-Kutta methods** stand out as the most popular because:

- They do not require the explicit computation of higher derivatives (unlike Taylor series methods).
- They can achieve high-order accuracy with relatively simple formulas.
- They are robust and flexible, applicable to a wide variety of differential equations.

The Runge-Kutta family includes methods of various orders:

- **First-Order Runge-Kutta (RK1)**: Equivalent to Eulerâ€™s method.
- **Second-Order Runge-Kutta (RK2)**: Also known as the Improved Euler or Heunâ€™s method, offering better accuracy.
- **Third-Order Runge-Kutta (RK3)**: Provides intermediate accuracy but is less commonly used.
- **Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta (RK4)**: The most popular method, offering excellent accuracy with manageable computational complexity.
- **Higher-Order Runge-Kutta Methods**: Methods of order five and above exist (such as the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg and Dormand-Prince methods) but are typically used for adaptive step-size control in more advanced applications.

## Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta Method (RK4)

The **Runge-Kutta methods** are a family of iterative methods for approximating the solution of **first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs)** of the form:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x, y), \quad y(x_0) = y_0
$$

Suppose we wish to find $$ y(x) $$ at $$ x = x_0 + h $$ given $$ y(x_0) = y_0 $$. The RK4 method uses the following steps:

### Formulae:

Compute intermediate slopes:

$$
\begin{aligned}
k_1 &= h f(x_0, y_0) \\
k_2 &= h f\left(x_0 + \frac{h}{2}, y_0 + \frac{k_1}{2}\right) \\
k_3 &= h f\left(x_0 + \frac{h}{2}, y_0 + \frac{k_2}{2}\right) \\
k_4 &= h f(x_0 + h, y_0 + k_3)
\end{aligned}
$$

Then, update the solution:

$$
y(x_0+h) = y_0 + \frac{1}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)
$$

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Start with initial conditions $$ (x_0, y_0) $$.
2. Choose a step size $$ h $$.
3. Compute $$ k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4 $$ using the given $$ f(x, y) $$.
4. Find the next value $$ y_1 $$ using the weighted average.
5. Update $$ x $$ to $$ x_1 = x_0 + h $$.
6. Repeat the process as needed.

## Example 1

### Problem:

Solve

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = x + y, \quad y(0) = 1
$$

Find $$ y(0.1) $$ using RK4 with step size $$ h = 0.1 $$.

---

### Solution:

Given:

$$
f(x,y) = x + y
$$

Initial conditions:

$$
x_0 = 0, \quad y_0 = 1, \quad h = 0.1
$$

Compute:

$$
\begin{aligned}
k_1 &= h f(x_0, y_0) = 0.1 (0 + 1) = 0.1 \\
k_2 &= h f\left(x_0 + \frac{h}{2}, y_0 + \frac{k_1}{2}\right) = 0.1 (0.05 + 1.05) = 0.1(1.1) = 0.11 \\
k_3 &= h f\left(x_0 + \frac{h}{2}, y_0 + \frac{k_2}{2}\right) = 0.1 (0.05 + 1.055) = 0.1(1.105) = 0.1105 \\
k_4 &= h f(x_0 + h, y_0 + k_3) = 0.1 (0.1 + 1.1105) = 0.1(1.2105) = 0.12105
\end{aligned}
$$

Now:

$$
\begin{aligned}
y(0.1) &= y_0 + \frac{1}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4) \\
&= 1 + \frac{1}{6}(0.1 + 2(0.11) + 2(0.1105) + 0.12105) \\
&= 1 + \frac{1}{6}(0.1 + 0.22 + 0.221 + 0.12105) \\
&= 1 + \frac{1}{6}(0.66205) \\
&= 1 + 0.11034 \\
&\approx 1.11034
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, $$ y(0.1) \approx 1.11034 $$.

## Example 2

### Problem:

Solve

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = y - x^2 + 1, \quad y(0) = 0.5
$$

Find $$ y(0.2) $$ using RK4 with step size $$ h = 0.2 $$.

---

### Solution:

Given:

$$
f(x,y) = y - x^2 + 1
$$

Initial conditions:

$$
x_0 = 0, \quad y_0 = 0.5, \quad h = 0.2
$$

Compute:

$$
\begin{aligned}
k_1 &= h f(x_0, y_0) = 0.2 (0.5 - 0^2 + 1) = 0.2(1.5) = 0.3 \\
k_2 &= h f\left(x_0 + \frac{h}{2}, y_0 + \frac{k_1}{2}\right) = 0.2\left( (0.5 + 0.15) - (0.1)^2 + 1 \right) \\
&= 0.2 (0.65 - 0.01 + 1) = 0.2(1.64) = 0.328 \\
k_3 &= h f\left(x_0 + \frac{h}{2}, y_0 + \frac{k_2}{2}\right) = 0.2 \left( (0.5 + 0.164) - (0.1)^2 + 1 \right) \\
&= 0.2(1.654) = 0.3308 \\
k_4 &= h f(x_0 + h, y_0 + k_3) = 0.2 \left( (0.5 + 0.3308) - (0.2)^2 + 1 \right) \\
&= 0.2(0.8308 - 0.04 + 1) = 0.2(1.7908) = 0.35816
\end{aligned}
$$

Now:

$$
\begin{aligned}
y(0.2) &= y_0 + \frac{1}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4) \\
&= 0.5 + \frac{1}{6}(0.3 + 2(0.328) + 2(0.3308) + 0.35816) \\
&= 0.5 + \frac{1}{6}(0.3 + 0.656 + 0.6616 + 0.35816) \\
&= 0.5 + \frac{1}{6}(1.97576) \\
&= 0.5 + 0.32929 \\
&= 0.82929
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, $$ y(0.2) \approx 0.82929 $$.

# ðŸ“š Additional Tips

- Always check step size $$h$$; a smaller $$h$$ increases accuracy but also computation.
- For computer implementation, `for` loops are typically used to advance $$x$$ and $$y$$.
- Runge-Kutta can be extended to systems of ODEs and higher-order ODEs.
