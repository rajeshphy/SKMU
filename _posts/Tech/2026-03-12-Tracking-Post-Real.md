## Booking – Start of Legal Custody

SMS received:

> Article No: CY190428668IN (BUSINESS_PARCEL) has been booked on 2026-02-06 10:38:02.

Website confirms  [oai_citation:1‡India Post.pdf](sediment://file_00000000276872088269dfce042e0419):

- Booked at: **E Commerce Centre Safdarjung**
- Origin Pincode: **110003**
- Tariff: **₹206.5**

From this moment, responsibility transferred to the department and routing procedures began.



## Dispatch from Origin Office

After acceptance, the parcel was:
- bagged,
- sorted,
- assigned transport,
- and pushed into the trunk network.

This is the beginning of long-distance movement.



## National Transit Chain (Step-by-Step)

Below is the actual progression recorded in order.

### 1. New Delhi RS TMO
First major transit handling after origin dispatch.

### 2. Hazrat Nizamuddin TMO
Another railway-linked sorting and exchange node strengthening outward connectivity.

### 3. MA Tatanagar RMS TMO
Entry toward Jharkhand direction; responsibility shifts deeper into regional network.

### 4. MA Ranchi RMS TMO
Major state gateway. Many parcels are re-routed or redistributed here.

### 5. MA Dhanbad RMS TMO
Further geographical narrowing toward Santhal region.

### 6. MA Jasidih RMS TMO
Important feeder toward Deoghar and Dumka side.



## Parcel Hub Intervention

### 7. L1 PH B. Deoghar

Here the parcel was:
- received,
- processed,
- bagged again,
- and dispatched.

Parcel hubs specialize in bulk reorganization and load optimization.



## Return to RMS for Final Direction

### 8. MA Jasidih RMS TMO (again)

After PH handling, it re-entered RMS channel for last transfer toward delivery headquarters.



## Arrival at Delivery District

### 9. Dumka HO – Item Received (12 Feb, 11:06 AM)

Critical milestone.

The parcel is no longer intercity.  
It is now inside the administrative boundary of the delivery unit.



## Invoicing & Beat Assignment

### Dumka HO – Item Invoiced (11:31 AM)

Now the system:
- mapped address,
- attached it to a route,
- selected delivery staff.

Ready for departure from office.



## Out for Delivery – Human Custody Stage

SMS:

> Delivery will be attempted by **TOPLI DEVI (BEAT_12)** on 2026-02-12.

Meaning:
The postwoman physically carried the parcel into her delivery bag.

Success time now depends on:
- beat order  
- traffic  
- load  
- recipient availability  

Not transport anymore.



## Successful Delivery

SMS:

> Delivery attempt for BUSINESS_PARCEL No: CY190428668IN is Successful on 2026-02-12 21:25:08.


Departmental liability ends here.
