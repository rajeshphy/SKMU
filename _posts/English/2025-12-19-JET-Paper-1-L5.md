## Calendar

The **solar year** consists of  
**365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 48 seconds**.  
This means that one complete revolution of the Earth around the Sun does not take an exact whole number of days. The extra **5 hours 48 minutes 48 seconds** accumulate every year and must be adjusted in the calendar to keep dates aligned with seasons.

In **47 BC**, Julius Caesar introduced the **Julian calendar** to correct this problem. In this calendar:
- An ordinary year was taken as **365 days**.
- Every year has an excess of nearly **$\tfrac{1}{4}$ day**.
- After four years, this excess becomes nearly **1 full day**.
- To account for this, **one extra day** was added once every **fourth year**.
- This extra day was added to February.
- Such a year is called a **leap year**.

Hence:
- $1\ \text{ordinary year} = 365\ \text{days} = 52\ \text{weeks} + 1\ \text{day}$
- $1\ \text{leap year} = 366\ \text{days} = 52\ \text{weeks} + 2\ \text{days}$

**Gregorian correction**

The length of the solar year is approximately $365.2422$ days, which is not exactly $365$ days.  
If every year were taken as $365$ days, the calendar would lose about $0.2422$ day each year, causing the seasons to slowly shift.

To correct this, an extra day was added every fourth year, giving an average year length of

$$
365 + \frac{1}{4} = 365.25 \text{ days}.
$$

This system was used in the Julian calendar. However, $365.25$ days is still slightly longer than the actual solar year. The small error of about $0.0078$ day per year accumulates and becomes significant over centuries.

To remove this accumulated error, the **Gregorian calendar** introduced a further correction:
- Every year divisible by $4$ is a leap year.
- Every year divisible by $100$ is **not** a leap year.
- Every year divisible by $400$ **is** a leap year.

Thus, century years such as $100$, $200$, and $300$ are not leap years, while $400$ is a leap year.

Because of this rule, in a cycle of $400$ years:
- Leap years = $97$
- Ordinary years = $303$

The average length of a Gregorian year becomes

$$
365 + \frac{97}{400} = 365.2425 \text{ days},
$$

which is very close to the actual solar year.  
This correction keeps the calendar aligned with the seasons and ensures that the pattern of days of the week repeats every $400$ years.


> India adopted the Gregorian calendar for civil use in 1753.
Therefore, for all Indian dates after 1753, standard Gregorian rules and the odd-days method give correct weekdays.

**A.D and B.C**

The years of the calendar are divided into two parts based on the birth of Jesus Christ.  
The years **after** the birth of Christ are called **A.D.** (Anno Domini), meaning *“in the year of the Lord”*.  
The years **before** the birth of Christ are called **B.C.** (Before Christ).

There is **no year zero** in the calendar.  
The year **1 B.C.** is immediately followed by **1 A.D.**

While counting years:
- In **A.D.**, years increase forward in time (1 A.D., 2 A.D., 3 A.D., …).
- In **B.C.**, years increase backward in time (1 B.C., 2 B.C., 3 B.C., …).

This difference is important while calculating odd days.

In **A.D.**, odd days are counted **forward** from the reference date  
(1 January 1 A.D., which was a Monday).

In **B.C.**, odd days are counted **backward**, because time moves in the reverse direction.

**Example (A.D.)**  
From 1 January 1 A.D. to 1 January 2 A.D.:
- Number of days = 365
- Odd days = 1  
So the day moves forward by 1 day.

**Example (B.C.)**  
From 1 January 1 A.D. to 1 January 1 B.C.:
- Number of days = 1
- Odd days = 1  
So the day moves **backward** by 1 day.

Thus, while solving calendar problems, special care must be taken to:
- Remember that there is **no year zero**
- Count odd days **forward for A.D.** dates
- Count odd days **backward for B.C.** dates


**Note:**  
1 January 1 A.D. was a **Monday**. This fixed reference date allows us to determine the day of the week for any future or past date.

**Odd Days**

A week has **7 days**. Any number of days greater than 7 can be expressed as complete weeks plus some extra days.  
These extra days are called **odd days**.

For example:
- 7 days = 1 week → **0 odd days**
- 8 days = 1 week + 1 day → **1 odd day**
- 9 days = 1 week + 2 days → **2 odd days**

Odd days determine how many days the calendar moves forward from a known reference day.

To find the day corresponding to a given date:
- Count the total number of days from the reference date up to that date.
- Divide this total by 7.
- The remainder obtained is the **number of odd days**.
- Move forward that many days from the reference day.

**Worked Example (Real-world)**  
1 January 1 A.D. was a **Monday**.  
Find the day of the week for 1 January of the next year.

- An ordinary year has **365 days**
- $365 = 52 \times 7 + 1$
- Number of odd days = **1**

So the day moves forward by 1 day:
- Monday → **Tuesday**

Therefore, **1 January of the next year is Tuesday**.

In a leap year:
- Total days = 366
- $366 = 52 \times 7 + 2$
- Number of odd days = **2**

So the day moves forward by 2 days:
- Monday → Wednesday

The day of the week corresponding to the number of odd days is given below.

| Odd Days | Day       |
|--:|--|
| 0 | Sunday |
| 1 | Monday |
| 2 | Tuesday |
| 3 | Wednesday |
| 4 | Thursday |
| 5 | Friday |
| 6 | Saturday |
