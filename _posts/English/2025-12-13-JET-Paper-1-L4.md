Ratio is a comparison of two or more quantities of the same kind, expressed in the form  
$$
a:b \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{a}{b}
$$

It forms the foundation for problems involving **numbers, mixtures, populations, committees, and value comparisons**.


## **1. Basic Properties of Ratio**

- If $a:b = c:d$, then  
  $$
  ad = bc \quad \text{(cross multiplication)}
  $$

- Ratios remain unchanged if both terms are multiplied or divided by the same non-zero number.

- A ratio has **no unit**.


## **2. Ratio in Numbers**

### **Digits of a Number**
For a two-digit number with digits $x$ (tens) and $y$ (units):

$$
\text{Number} = 10x + y
$$

This idea is frequently used in ratio-based number problems.

## **3. Ratio as Fractions**

A ratio can be converted into a fraction and vice versa.

Example:
$$
a:b = \frac{a}{b}
$$

Many exam questions convert verbal statements into fractions and then equate ratios.


## **4. Ratio in Populations / Committees**

When total members are unknown, assume the total to be $x$.

Fractions of groups are then expressed as parts of $x$, which makes calculations systematic.


## **5. Ratio in Mixtures**

If ingredients are mixed in given ratios, the final proportion depends on:
- Quantity taken from each mixture
- Relative proportions of components

Equality of components often leads to **equating algebraic expressions**.


## **6. Ratio and Value Proportionality**

Sometimes value is **not proportional to weight**, but to:
- Square of weight
- Cube of weight

This is common in questions involving **precious stones, wires, or metals**.

## **Exercise Problems (Based on NET Pattern)**

### **Q1. (NET DEC-2016)**
The sum of digits of a two-digit number is 9.  
The fraction formed by taking 9 less than the number as numerator and 9 more than the number as denominator is $ \frac{3}{4} $.  
Find the number.

(a) 36  
(b) 63  
(c) 45  
(d) 54  


### **Q2. (NET DEC-2016)**
Nine-elevenths of the members of a parliamentary committee are men.  
Of the men, two-thirds are from the Rajya Sabha.  
Further, $ \frac{7}{11} $ of the total committee members are from the Rajya Sabha.  
What fraction of the total members are women from the Lok Sabha?

(a) $ \frac{1}{11} $  
(b) $ \frac{6}{11} $  
(c) $ \frac{2}{11} $  
(d) $ \frac{3}{11} $



### **Q3. (NET JUNE-2018)**
Two solutions $X$ and $Y$ contain ingredients $A, B, C$ in the ratios  
$$
a:b:c \quad \text{and} \quad c:b:a
$$
respectively.  
They are mixed so that the resultant mixture contains equal proportions of $A, B,$ and $C$.  
Find the correct relation.

(a) $ b = \frac{c-a}{2} $  
(b) $ c = \frac{a+b}{2} $  
(c) $ c = \frac{a-b}{2} $  
(d) $ b = \frac{a+c}{2} $



### **Q4. (NET JUNE-2019)**
A precious stone breaks into four pieces having weights in the ratio $1:2:3:4$.  
The value of the stone is proportional to the square of its weight.  
Find the percentage loss in value due to breaking.

(a) 0  
(b) 30  
(c) 70  
(d) 90  



## **Solutions (Concise and Concept-Oriented)**

### **Solution 1**
Let the number be $10x + y$.  
Given:
$$
x + y = 9
$$
$$
\frac{10x + y - 9}{10x + y + 9} = \frac{3}{4}
$$
Solving gives $y = 6,\; x = 3$.  
Number = **63**

✅ **Answer: (b)**

---

### **Solution 2**
Let total committee members = $x$.

- Men = $ \frac{9x}{11} $
- Men from Rajya Sabha = $ \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{9x}{11} = \frac{6x}{11} $
- Total Rajya Sabha members = $ \frac{7x}{11} $

Women from Rajya Sabha:
$$
\frac{7x}{11} - \frac{6x}{11} = \frac{x}{11}
$$

Lok Sabha members = $ x - \frac{7x}{11} = \frac{4x}{11} $

Women from Lok Sabha:
$$
\frac{4x}{11} - \frac{3x}{11} = \frac{x}{11}
$$

Fraction = $ \frac{1}{11} $

✅ **Answer: (a)**

---

### **Solution 3**
Let equal quantities of $X$ and $Y$ be mixed.

Equality of components implies:
$$
a + c = 2b
\Rightarrow b = \frac{a+c}{2}
$$

✅ **Answer: (d)**

---

### **Solution 4**
Weights = $k, 2k, 3k, 4k$

Original value:
$$
\propto (10k)^2 = 100k^2
$$

Value after breaking:
$$
\propto (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2)k^2 = 30k^2
$$

Loss:
$$
\frac{100 - 30}{100} \times 100 = 70\%
$$

✅ **Answer: (c)**
