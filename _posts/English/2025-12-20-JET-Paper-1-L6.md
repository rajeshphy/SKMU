## Clock

A clock is a device used to measure and indicate time. An ordinary analog clock has **two hands**:
- **Hour hand (H.H.)** — the shorter hand, which shows the hour
- **Minute hand (M.H.)** — the longer hand, which shows the minutes

The clock face is divided into:
- **12 equal hour divisions**, numbered from 1 to 12
- **60 equal minute divisions** around the dial

Since the clock has 60 minute divisions and only 12 hour numbers, each hour number is separated by:

$$
\frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ minute divisions}
$$



**Angular Movement**

A complete rotation around the clock dial corresponds to a full circle:

$$
1 \text{ complete circle} = 360^\circ
$$

Hence:
- One minute division corresponds to  

  $$
  \frac{360^\circ}{60} = 6^\circ
  $$

- Five minute divisions (distance between two consecutive hour numbers) correspond to  

  $$
  6^\circ \times 5 = 30^\circ
  $$

Therefore:
- The **hour hand moves $30^\circ$ in one hour**

In one minute:
- Hour hand moves  

  $$
  \frac{30^\circ}{60} = \frac{1}{2}^\circ
  $$

- Minute hand moves

  $$
  6^\circ
  $$

Thus, in one minute, the **minute hand gains over the hour hand**:

$$
6^\circ - \frac{1}{2}^\circ = 5\frac{1}{2}^\circ
$$

This relative gain is the key idea used in solving all clock problems.



**Relative Motion of Hands**

Since the minute hand gains $5\frac{1}{2}^\circ$ per minute over the hour hand, in one hour (60 minutes) it gains:

$$
5\frac{1}{2}^\circ \times 60 = 330^\circ
$$

As a full circle is $360^\circ$, the remaining angle is:

$$
360^\circ - 330^\circ = 30^\circ
$$

This shows that the relative position of the two hands repeats after the minute hand gains $360^\circ$ over the hour hand.

Hence:
- Any particular relative position of the two hands occurs **11 times in 12 hours**



**Special Positions of Clock Hands**

Certain positions of the hands are of special importance:
- **Coincidence**: both hands overlap and are in the same direction
- **Opposite direction**: hands are $180^\circ$ apart, corresponding to 30 minute divisions
- **Right angle**: hands are $90^\circ$ apart, corresponding to 15 minute divisions

From the relative motion analysis, the following standard results are obtained:
- In every hour, the hands **coincide once**
- In 12 hours, the hands coincide **11 times**
- In a day (24 hours), the hands coincide **22 times**
- In 12 hours, the hands are in opposite directions **11 times**
- In 12 hours, the hands are at right angles **22 times**
- In one hour, the hands are at right angles **2 times**
- In one hour, the hands are in opposite directions **once**
- In a day, the hands are at right angles **44 times**



**Time Between Coincidences**

Since the hands coincide 11 times in 12 hours, the time between two successive coincidences is:

$$
\frac{12 \times 60}{11} = 65\frac{5}{11}\ \text{minutes}
$$

This value is taken as the **standard interval** between coincidences for a correct clock.

- If the hands coincide in **less than** $65\frac{5}{11}$ minutes, the clock is said to be **fast**
- If the hands coincide in **more than** $65\frac{5}{11}$ minutes, the clock is said to be **slow**



**Fast and Slow Clock**

A clock is said to be:
- **Fast**, if it shows a time ahead of the correct time  
  Example: Showing **6:10** when the correct time is **6:00**
- **Slow**, if it shows a time behind the correct time  
  Example: Showing **5:50** when the correct time is **6:00**

If the hands of a clock coincide at an interval of $x$ minutes:

- When $x < 65\frac{5}{11}$, the clock is **fast** and the time gained per hour is:
  
  $$
  \frac{65\frac{5}{11} - x}{x}\ \text{minutes}
  $$

- When $x > 65\frac{5}{11}$, the clock is **slow** and the time lost per hour is:
  
  $$
  \frac{x - 65\frac{5}{11}}{x}\ \text{minutes}
  $$

These relations are frequently used in numerical problems involving gain or loss of time in clocks.
