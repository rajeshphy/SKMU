# Macroscopic Dielectric Constant

---


**Learning Objectives**:
- Understand the concept of macroscopic dielectric constant in materials.
- Explore the relationship between electric field, polarization, and dielectric behavior.
- Apply the concept to calculate fields, capacitance, and material properties.

**Key Concepts / Definitions**:
- **Dielectric Constant ($\varepsilon_r$)**: The ratio of the permittivity of a material to the permittivity of free space. It measures the material's ability to reduce the electric field:
  $$
  \varepsilon_r = \frac{\varepsilon}{\varepsilon_0}
  $$
- **Polarization ($\vec{P}$)**: The dipole moment per unit volume of a dielectric, induced by an external electric field.
- **Electric Susceptibility ($\chi_e$)**: A dimensionless quantity that describes how easily a material can be polarized:
  $$
  \vec{P} = \varepsilon_0 \chi_e \vec{E}
  $$

**Theory and Explanation**:

When an external electric field is applied to a dielectric material, the bound charges within atoms or molecules slightly displace, creating induced dipoles. The collective effect of these dipoles leads to a net polarization $\vec{P}$ in the material.

This polarization generates an internal electric field that partially cancels the applied field, resulting in a reduced **macroscopic electric field** $\vec{E}$ inside the material.

To describe the behavior of a dielectric, we define the **electric displacement field** $\vec{D}$:
$$
\vec{D} = \varepsilon_0 \vec{E} + \vec{P}
$$

In linear, isotropic, and homogeneous dielectrics, polarization is directly proportional to the electric field:
$$
\vec{P} = \varepsilon_0 \chi_e \vec{E}
$$

Substituting this into the equation for $\vec{D}$ gives:
$$
\vec{D} = \varepsilon_0 (1 + \chi_e) \vec{E} = \varepsilon \vec{E}
$$

Thus, the **permittivity** of the dielectric is:
$$
\varepsilon = \varepsilon_0 (1 + \chi_e)
$$

And the **dielectric constant** (relative permittivity) is:
$$
\varepsilon_r = \frac{\varepsilon}{\varepsilon_0} = 1 + \chi_e
$$

This quantity indicates how much the presence of the dielectric reduces the internal electric field compared to vacuum.

**Mathematical Formulation**:

- Electric displacement field:
  $$
  \vec{D} = \varepsilon_0 \vec{E} + \vec{P}
  $$

- Polarization in linear media:
  $$
  \vec{P} = \varepsilon_0 \chi_e \vec{E}
  $$

- Displacement field in terms of dielectric constant:
  $$
  \vec{D} = \varepsilon \vec{E}
  $$

- Dielectric constant:
  $$
  \varepsilon_r = \frac{\varepsilon}{\varepsilon_0} = 1 + \chi_e
  $$

- Capacitance with dielectric:
  $$
  C = \varepsilon_r \cdot C_0 = \varepsilon_r \cdot \frac{\varepsilon_0 A}{d}
  $$

Where:
- $C_0$ = Capacitance in vacuum
- $A$ = Area of capacitor plates
- $d$ = Distance between plates

**Solved Examples**:

- **Example 1**:  
  **Problem**: A parallel-plate capacitor has vacuum between the plates and a capacitance of 10 pF. What will be its capacitance if a dielectric with dielectric constant $\varepsilon_r = 4$ is inserted?  
  **Solution**:  
  $$
  C = \varepsilon_r \cdot C_0 = 4 \cdot 10 = 40 \, \text{pF}
  $$  
  **Answer**: 40 pF

- **Example 2**:  
  **Problem**: A dielectric has a polarization $\vec{P} = 2 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{C/m}^2$ and is subjected to an electric field $E = 500 \, \text{V/m}$. Find its dielectric constant.  
  **Solution**:  
  $$
  \chi_e = \frac{P}{\varepsilon_0 E} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-7}}{8.85 \times 10^{-12} \times 500} \approx 45.2
  $$
  $$
  \varepsilon_r = 1 + \chi_e = 1 + 45.2 = 46.2
  $$  
  **Answer**: $\varepsilon_r \approx 46.2$

**Important Points / Summary**:
- The dielectric constant describes the material's ability to reduce an internal electric field.
- It is dimensionless and always greater than or equal to 1.
- A higher $\varepsilon_r$ implies better electric insulation and greater capacitance.
