# 🔷 Where You Stand (Important)

You have already worked on:

1. **One-parameter rationally extended harmonic oscillator**
2. **Multi-dimensional rational extensions**

This means you are already familiar with:

- Shape invariance beyond textbook forms  
- Exceptional orthogonal polynomials (EOPs)  
- Higher-order SUSY / Darboux transformations  
- Multi-dimensional factorization  

So **do not** go back to:  
❌ basic Morse / Coulomb  
❌ first-order SUSY examples  
❌ standard shape-invariant lists

# 🔥 HIGH-VALUE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS (Strongly Recommended)

## 1️⃣ **Multi-Step / Higher-Order SUSY in Multi-Dimensions**

**Natural next step from your work**

### Problem ideas:

- Construct **two-step and k-step SUSY chains** for rationally extended oscillators in (D > 1)  
- Study **spectral degeneracy breaking** due to higher-order intertwining operators  
- Explore **reducible vs irreducible SUSY** in higher dimensions  

📌 *Why important:*  
Almost no systematic classification exists for higher-order SUSY in multi-D systems.

📌 *Possible outcome:*  
A clean classification paper.

---

## 2️⃣ **Non-Hermitian / PT-Symmetric SUSY-QM**

**Hot and under-explored**

### Concrete problems:

- Construct **PT-symmetric rational extensions** of:
  - Harmonic oscillator  
  - Scarf / Rosen–Morse potentials  
- Analyze:
  - Reality of spectrum  
  - SUSY breaking/restoration  
- Study **biorthogonal EOPs**

📌 *Why publishable:*  
PT-SUSY is still poorly understood mathematically.

📌 *Keywords to use:*  
`PT symmetry`, `pseudo-Hermiticity`, `non-Hermitian SUSY`

---

## 3️⃣ **Position-Dependent Mass (PDM) SUSY-QM**

**Very strong direction**

### Research problems:

- Construct SUSY partner Hamiltonians with:
  \[
  H = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{1}{m(x)}\frac{d}{dx}\right) + V(x)
  \]
- Find **shape-invariant PDM systems**
- Build **rational extensions with EOPs**

📌 *Why valuable:*  
Relevant to semiconductors, quantum wells, nanostructures.

📌 *Almost guaranteed publication* if done cleanly.

---

## 4️⃣ **Matrix SUSY-QM (Coupled Channels)**

**Advanced but powerful**

### Problems:

- Construct **2×2 or 3×3 SUSY partner Hamiltonians**
- Study:
  - Spin-orbit coupling  
  - Coupled oscillators  
- Develop **matrix shape invariance**

📌 *Why rare:*  
Very few researchers work on **matrix SUSY systematically**.

📌 *Ideal if you like algebra.*

---

## 5️⃣ **Conditional and Broken Shape Invariance**

**Mathematically deep**

### Possible projects:

- Systems where shape invariance holds **only for specific parameter values**
- Explore **spontaneously broken SUSY**
- Study zero-mode disappearance

📌 *Connection:*  
Links SUSY-QM to phase transitions.

---

# 🚀 MODERN / EMERGING DIRECTIONS (High Impact)

## 6️⃣ **SUSY-QM on Curved Spaces**

Examples:

- SUSY on:
  - Sphere (S²)
  - Hyperbolic space  
- Rational extensions in curved backgrounds

📌 *Why interesting:*  
Links SUSY-QM with gravity and geometry.

---

## 7️⃣ **Exceptional Orthogonal Polynomials: Classification Problems**

Instead of building potentials:

- Classify **new EOP families**
- Study completeness and orthogonality rigorously
- Multi-index EOP systems

📌 *Highly mathematical, very publishable*

---

## 8️⃣ **Supersymmetry + Integrability**

- Connection between:
  - SUSY-QM  
  - Painlevé equations  
  - Lax pairs  
- Deformed oscillator algebras

📌 *Strong journals like JMP, JPA accept these*

---

# 🎯 How to Decide What to Work On

Ask yourself:

- **Algebra lover?** → Matrix SUSY, higher-order SUSY  
- **Physics applications?** → PDM SUSY, PT-SUSY  
- **Pure math elegance?** → EOP classification  
- **Fast publication?** → PDM or PT-SUSY
