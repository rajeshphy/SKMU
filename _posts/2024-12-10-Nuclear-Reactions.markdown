The two general kinds of nuclear reactions are:
1. Nuclear Decay
2. Nuclear Transmutation

In a nuclear decay reaction, also called radioactive decay, an unstable nucleus emits radiation and transforms into the nucleus of one or more other elements. This process happens spontaneously due to the imbalance of forces within the nucleus, such as an excess of protons or neutrons, or an unfavorable energy configuration. The resulting daughter nuclei have a lower mass and are lower in energy (more stable) than the parent nucleus that decayed. In contrast, in a nuclear transmutation reaction, a nucleus of one element is bombarded with a small particle or another nucleus, and the bombarded nucleus is transformed into a more massive nucleus than the starting nucleus.

It can be seen from the above figure that the decay may or may not change the mass number $A$ and the atomic number $Z$ of the nucleus.

### Q-Value of Nuclear Reaction
The **reaction energy $Q$** in a nuclear reaction represents the difference between the initial and final rest energies of the participating nuclei. Mathematically, it is given by:  

$$Q = (M_a + M_X - M_Y - M_b)c^2$$

where $M_a$ and $M_b$ are the masses of the reactants, $M_X$ and $M_Y$ are the masses of the products, and $c$ is the speed of light.

A positive $Q$-value indicates an **exothermic reaction**, where energy is released. For example, in the reaction 

$$\ce{^1H + ^7Li -> ^4He + ^4He}$$ , 

the $Q$-value is $Q = 17.3 \, \mathrm{MeV}$. Such reactions often release energy in the form of kinetic energy of the products, making them energetically favorable.

Conversely, a negative $Q$-value corresponds to an **endothermic reaction**, where energy must be supplied for the reaction to occur. For an endothermic reaction, the bombarding particle must have kinetic energy greater than the magnitude of $Q$. This minimum energy required to initiate the reaction is known as the **threshold energy**, and it ensures conservation of momentum and energy in the isolated system.
