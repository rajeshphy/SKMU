The two general kinds of nuclear reactions are:
1. Nuclear Decay
2. Nuclear Transmutation

In a nuclear decay reaction, also called radioactive decay, an unstable nucleus emits radiation and transforms into the nucleus of one or more other elements. This process happens spontaneously due to the imbalance of forces within the nucleus, such as an excess of protons or neutrons, or an unfavorable energy configuration. The resulting daughter nuclei have a lower mass and are lower in energy (more stable) than the parent nucleus that decayed. In contrast, in a nuclear transmutation reaction, a nucleus of one element is bombarded with a small particle or another nucleus, and the bombarded nucleus is transformed into a more massive nucleus than the starting nucleus.

There are six fundamentally different kinds of nuclear decay reactions, and each releases a different kind of particle or energy. The essential features of each reaction are shown in Fig-2. The sixth kind is the spontaneous fission. It can be seen from the above figure that the decay may or may not change the mass number $A$ and the atomic number $Z$ of the nucleus.

### Q-Value of Nuclear Reaction

Nuclear reactions can occur when a target nucleus $X$ is bombarded by a particle $a$, resulting in a daughter nucleus $Y$ and an outgoing particle $b$:  

$$
a + X \rightarrow Y + b
$$

The **reaction energy $Q$** in a nuclear reaction represents the difference between the initial and final rest energies of the participating nuclei. Mathematically, it is given by:  

$$Q = (M_a + M_X - M_b - M_Y)c^2$$

where $M_a$ and $M_X$ are the masses of the reactants, $M_b$ and $M_Y$ are the masses of the products, and $c$ is the speed of light.

A positive $Q$-value indicates an **exothermic reaction**, where energy is released. For example, in the reaction:

$$\ce{^1_1H + ^7_3Li -> ^4_2He + ^4_2He}$$ ,

the $Q$-value is $Q = 17.3 \, \mathrm{MeV}$. Such reactions often release energy in the form of kinetic energy of the products, making them energetically favorable.

Conversely, a negative $Q$-value corresponds to an **endothermic reaction**, where energy must be supplied for the reaction to occur. For an endothermic reaction, the bombarding particle must have kinetic energy greater than the magnitude of $Q$. This minimum energy required to initiate the reaction is known as the **threshold energy**, and it ensures conservation of momentum and energy in the isolated system.

### Problem 1: Q Value Calculation for Alpha Decay of $^{226}\text{Ra}$

The $^{226}\text{Ra}$ nucleus undergoes alpha decay according to 

$$
_{88}^{226}\text{Ra} \rightarrow _{86}^{222}\text{Rn} + _2^4\text{He}
$$

Calculate the Q value for this process using the formula $Q = \left( M_{\text{initial}} - M_{\text{final}} \right)\times 931.494 MeV/u$. The masses are:
- $226.025408 \, \text{u}$ for $_{88}^{226}\text{Ra}$
- $222.017576 \, \text{u}$ for $_{86}^{222}\text{Rn}$
- $4.002603 \, \text{u}$ for $_2^4\text{He}$.


### Problem 2: Energy Released by Fission of 1.00 kg of $^{235}\text{U}$

Calculate the energy released when 1.00 kg of $^{235}\text{U}$ undergoes fission, given that the disintegration energy per event is $Q = 208 \, \text{MeV}$.

*Answer:*     $5.33\times10^{26}MeV$

*How much is this energy?*  The energy released in the fission of 1 kg of $^{235}\text{U}$, if released slowly, is enough to keep a 100-W lightbulb operating for 30,000 years! If the available fission energy in 1 kg of $^{235}\text{U}$ were suddenly released, it would be equivalent to detonating about 20,000 tons of TNT.

### Problem 3: Identifying Unknown Nuclides and Particles

Identify the unknown nuclides and particles $X$ and $X'$ in the following nuclear reactions:  

(a) $X + _2^4\text{He} \rightarrow _{12}^{24}\text{Mg} + _0^1\text{n}$  
(b) $ _{92}^{235}\text{U} + _0^1\text{n} \rightarrow _{38}^{90}\text{Sr} + X + 2( _0^1\text{n})$  
(c) $2( _1^1\text{H}) \rightarrow  _1^2\text{H} + X + X'$
