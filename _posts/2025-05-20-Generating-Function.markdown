## **Canonical Transformations**

Canonical transformations simplify problems in Hamiltonian mechanics by transforming to new variables $(Q, P)$ that preserve the structure of Hamilton's equations:

$$
\dot{q} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p}, \quad \dot{p} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\dot{Q} = \frac{\partial K}{\partial P}, \quad \dot{P} = -\frac{\partial K}{\partial Q}
$$

Here, $K(Q, P, t)$ is the new Hamiltonian in terms of transformed variables.


## **Generating Functions of Canonical Transformations**

A generating function $F$ allows us to define a canonical transformation in such a way that the new coordinates $(Q, P)$ are derived systematically from the old ones $(q, p)$. 

The key identity is:

$$
p \, dq - P \, dQ = dF
$$

This implies the **transformation is symplectic**, meaning it preserves the area in phase space:

$$
\int_C p \, dq = \int_{C'} P \, dQ
$$

Using different choices of independent variables in $F$, we define four standard types of generating functions.

In Hamiltonian mechanics, **generating functions** define canonical transformations and can be written in different forms depending on the choice of independent variables. The four standard types ‚Äî $F_1$, $F_2$, $F_3$, and $F_4$ ‚Äî are **interrelated via Legendre transformations**, which exchange variables in a controlled manner.

We begin with **Type I**: $F_1(q, Q)$ and obtain the others by performing **Legendre transformations** with respect to $q$, $Q$, or both.



#### **Type I**: $F_1(q, Q)$

This is the fundamental generating function from which others can be derived. It depends on the old coordinate $q$ and the new coordinate $Q$.

From the differential identity:

$$
dF_1 = p \, dq - P \, dQ
$$

We read off:

$$
p = \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial q}, \quad
P = -\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial Q}
$$



#### **Type II**: $F_2(q, P)$

To eliminate the new coordinate $Q$ and introduce the new momentum $P$, we perform a Legendre transformation of $F_1$ with respect to $Q$:

$$
F_2(q, P) = F_1(q, Q) + P Q
$$

Differentiating:

$$
dF_2 = dF_1 + P \, dQ + Q \, dP = p \, dq + Q \, dP
$$

Therefore:

$$
p = \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial q}, \quad
Q = \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial P}
$$



#### **Type III**: $F_3(p, Q)$

To express the generating function in terms of the old momentum $p$ and new coordinate $Q$, we Legendre transform $F_1$ with respect to $q$:

$$
F_3(p, Q) = F_1(q, Q) - p q
$$

Differentiating:

$$
dF_3 = dF_1 - p \, dq - q \, dp = -P \, dQ - q \, dp
$$

So we obtain:

$$
q = -\frac{\partial F_3}{\partial p}, \quad
P = -\frac{\partial F_3}{\partial Q}
$$


#### **Type IV**: $F_4(p, P)$

This form uses both momenta, old and new. It is obtained by Legendre transforming $F_1$ with respect to both $q$ and $Q$:

$$
F_4(p, P) = F_1(q, Q) - p q + P Q
$$

Differentiating:

$$
dF_4 = dF_1 - p \, dq - q \, dp + P \, dQ + Q \, dP = -q \, dp + Q \, dP
$$

Hence:

$$
q = -\frac{\partial F_4}{\partial p}, \quad
Q = \frac{\partial F_4}{\partial P}
$$

### üîÅ Summary Table

| Type   | Generating Function   | Relations |
|--------|------------------------|-----------|
| I      | $F_1(q, Q)$            | $p = \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial q}, \quad P = -\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial Q}$ |
| II     | $F_2(q, P)$            | $p = \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial q}, \quad Q = \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial P}$ |
| III    | $F_3(p, Q)$            | $q = -\frac{\partial F_3}{\partial p}, \quad P = -\frac{\partial F_3}{\partial Q}$ |
| IV     | $F_4(p, P)$            | $q = -\frac{\partial F_4}{\partial p}, \quad Q = \frac{\partial F_4}{\partial P}$ |



### **Infinitesimal Canonical Transformations**

For small transformations generated by a function $G(q, p)$:

$$
\delta q = \epsilon \{q, G\} = \epsilon \frac{\partial G}{\partial p}, \quad
\delta p = \epsilon \{p, G\} = -\epsilon \frac{\partial G}{\partial q}
$$

Here, $\epsilon$ is a small parameter. If $\\{G, H\\} = 0$, then $G$ is conserved and the transformation is a symmetry of the system.



### üîó Relation Between Hamiltonian and Generating Function

In classical mechanics, a **generating function** defines a **canonical transformation**, which maps one set of canonical variables $(q, p)$ to another $(Q, P)$, preserving the form of Hamilton's equations.

We now explore how the **Hamiltonian** is related to the **generating function**, starting from the action integral.

---

#### üß≠ The Action Integral

The action in Hamiltonian mechanics is:

$$
S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \left( p \, \dot{q} - H(q, p, t) \right) dt
$$

If we perform a **canonical transformation** from $(q, p)$ to $(Q, P)$, the action becomes:

$$
S' = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \left( P \, \dot{Q} - K(Q, P, t) \right) dt
$$

Here, $K$ is the **new Hamiltonian** in the transformed variables.

---

#### üîÑ Inserting the Generating Function

Let the transformation be generated by a function $F_1(q, Q, t)$ of type I. The **total differential** of $F_1$ is:

$$
dF_1 = \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial q} dq + \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial Q} dQ + \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial t} dt
$$

We want to preserve the action up to a total derivative:

$$
\int \left( p \, \dot{q} - H \right) dt \quad \longrightarrow \quad \int \left( P \, \dot{Q} - K \right) dt
$$

To ensure the equations of motion remain invariant, the two Lagrangian forms should differ by an **exact differential**:

$$
p \, dq - H \, dt = P \, dQ - K \, dt + dF_1
$$

Here, $F_1$ is some **function of the canonical variables** (possibly also of time), whose **total differential** $dF_1$ adjusts for the change of variables.

---

#### üìå Matching Terms

From the differential identity:

$$
p \, dq - H \, dt = P \, dQ - K \, dt + \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial q} dq + \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial Q} dQ + \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial t} dt
$$

Group terms:

- Coefficients of $dq$: $p = \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial q}$
- Coefficients of $dQ$: $P = -\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial Q}$
- Coefficients of $dt$: 

  $$
  -H = -K + \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial t} \quad \Rightarrow \quad K = H + \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial t}
  $$

## **Bridge to Hamilton-Jacobi Theory**

By appropriately choosing a generating function, we can transform a complicated Hamiltonian system into a simpler one‚Äîideally into a system where the new Hamiltonian $K$ is zero or depends only on momenta, which allows direct integration.

This motivates the transition to **Hamilton-Jacobi Theory**.

The Hamilton-Jacobi theory arises from seeking a generating function (typically of Type II) that **completely solves the equations of motion**.

Let us consider a generating function of Type II: $F_2(q, P, t)$, and define it as **Hamilton‚Äôs Principal Function**:

$$
S(q, P, t) = F_2(q, P, t)
$$

From this function, the transformation equations are:

$$
p_i = \frac{\partial S}{\partial q_i}, \quad Q_i = \frac{\partial S}{\partial P_i}
$$

If we desire the new Hamiltonian $K(Q, P, t) = 0$, then from the relation:

$$
K = H(q, p, t) + \frac{\partial S}{\partial t}
$$

and substituting $p_i = \frac{\partial S}{\partial q_i}$, we obtain the **Hamilton-Jacobi Equation**:

$$
H\left(q_1, \dots, q_n, \frac{\partial S}{\partial q_1}, \dots, \frac{\partial S}{\partial q_n}, t \right)
+ \frac{\partial S}{\partial t} = 0
$$

Solving this **partial differential equation** gives us the principal function $S(q, P, t)$, which contains complete information about the system‚Äôs dynamics.

## **Solved Examples**

- **Example 1**:  
  Show that the transformation defined by $F_2(q, P) = \frac{1}{2}mq^2 \cot P$ is canonical.  
  **Solution**:  
  $$
  p = \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial q} = mq \cot P, \quad
  Q = \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial P} = -\frac{1}{2}mq^2 \csc^2 P
  $$  
  The transformation is canonical as it preserves Poisson brackets.

- **Example 2**:  
  Use an infinitesimal generator $G = q$ to find the transformation of $q$ and $p$.
  $$
  \delta q = \epsilon \{q, q\} = 0, \quad \delta p = \epsilon \{p, q\} = -\epsilon
  $$
