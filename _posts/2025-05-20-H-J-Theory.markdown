**Key Concepts / Definitions**:
- **Hamilton–Jacobi Equation**: A first-order partial differential equation for the action function $S(q, t)$ derived from Hamilton’s equations.
- **Action Function ($S$)**: A function whose complete solution generates the equations of motion via canonical transformation.
- **Harmonic Oscillator**: A system in which a particle experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement.

**Theory and Explanation**:

The **Hamilton–Jacobi equation (HJE)** is an alternative formulation of classical mechanics that can be used to solve the equations of motion by solving a partial differential equation. It is especially powerful because it reduces the problem of dynamics to integration.

The central idea is to find a generating function $S(q, t)$ such that the transformation to new coordinates results in constant generalized momenta. This function $S$ satisfies the Hamilton–Jacobi equation:

$$
\frac{\partial S}{\partial t} + H\left(q, \frac{\partial S}{\partial q}, t\right) = 0
$$

If $S(q, t)$ is known, then the equations of motion can be obtained by simple differentiation, and the trajectories can be determined directly.

**Mathematical Formulation**:

Let the Hamiltonian of a system be:

$$
H(q, p, t)
$$

We define the action function $S(q, \alpha, t)$, where $\alpha$ are constants of integration. The canonical momentum is:

$$
p_i = \frac{\partial S}{\partial q_i}
$$

Then the **Hamilton–Jacobi equation** is:

$$
\frac{\partial S}{\partial t} + H\left(q, \frac{\partial S}{\partial q}, t\right) = 0
$$

For **time-independent systems**, we use **separation of variables**:

$$
S(q, t) = W(q) - Et
$$

Substituting into HJE gives:

$$
H\left(q, \frac{\partial W}{\partial q}\right) = E
$$

**Solved Examples**:

- **Example 1**:  
  **Problem**: Derive the Hamilton–Jacobi equation for a 1D harmonic oscillator and find the action function.  
  **Solution**:

  The Hamiltonian of a 1D harmonic oscillator is:

  $$
  H = \frac{p^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 q^2
  $$

  Assume $S(q, t) = W(q) - Et$, then the time-independent HJE becomes:

  $$
  \frac{1}{2m} \left( \frac{dW}{dq} \right)^2 + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 q^2 = E
  $$

  Solving:

  $$
  \left( \frac{dW}{dq} \right)^2 = 2m \left( E - \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 q^2 \right)
  $$

  $$
  \frac{dW}{dq} = \sqrt{2mE - m^2 \omega^2 q^2}
  $$

  Integrating:

  $$
  W(q) = \int \sqrt{2mE - m^2 \omega^2 q^2} \, dq
  $$

  Let $A^2 = \frac{2E}{m \omega^2}$, then:

  $$
  W(q) = \frac{E}{\omega} \arcsin \left( \frac{q}{A} \right) + \frac{m \omega}{2} q \sqrt{A^2 - q^2}
  $$

  Hence, the full action is:

  $$
  S(q, t) = W(q) - Et
  $$

- **Example 2**:  
  **Problem**: Using the Hamilton–Jacobi method, find the trajectory of a particle in a harmonic oscillator potential.  
  **Solution**:

  From the previous example, we know $S(q, t) = W(q) - Et$.

  From the Hamilton–Jacobi method:

  $$
  \frac{\partial S}{\partial E} = \text{constant} = \beta
  $$

  So,

  $$
  \frac{\partial W}{\partial E} - t = \beta
  $$

  Using $W(q)$ from before:

  $$
  \frac{\partial W}{\partial E} = \frac{1}{\omega} \arcsin \left( \frac{q}{A} \right)
  $$

  Therefore:

  $$
  \frac{1}{\omega} \arcsin \left( \frac{q}{A} \right) - t = \beta \Rightarrow \frac{q}{A} = \sin(\omega t + \phi)
  $$

  Thus, the trajectory is:

  $$
  q(t) = A \sin(\omega t + \phi)
  $$

  which is the expected solution for a harmonic oscillator.
