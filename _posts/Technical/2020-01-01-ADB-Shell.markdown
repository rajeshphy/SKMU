## 3. 📲 Enable USB Debugging on Android

### On Your Phone (e.g., Oppo F7):

1. Go to **Settings > About Phone**
2. Tap **Build Number** 7 times to enable Developer Options
3. Go to **Settings > Additional Settings > Developer Options**
4. Enable **USB Debugging**

## 4. 🔌 Connect Phone to Mac

- Use a **USB data cable**
- Set USB mode to **File Transfer (MTP)**
