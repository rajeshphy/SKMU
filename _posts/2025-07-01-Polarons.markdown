In solid-state physics, **polarons** are quasiparticles formed due to the interaction of an electron (or hole) with the phonons (quantized lattice vibrations) in an ionic crystal. This interaction leads to a modification of the electron's motion, as it becomes "dressed" with a polarization cloud of lattice distortion. 

A key observable effect of electron-phonon interaction is the **temperature dependence of electrical resistivity**. As temperature increases:

- The number of phonons increases.
- This leads to **more scattering of electrons**, which increases the resistivity.

Example: In pure copper,
- At 0 °C, resistivity ≈ 1.55 μΩ·cm
- At 100 °C, resistivity ≈ 2.28 μΩ·cm

Above the **Debye temperature** (θ<sub>D</sub> ≈ 70 °C for Cu), the phonon population becomes roughly proportional to the **absolute temperature (T)**, so:

$$
\rho(T) \propto T
$$

## Vibrational Modes in Ionic Crystals

In a crystal, atoms vibrate about their equilibrium positions, leading to the formation of **phonon branches**:

- **Acoustic Modes**: Low-energy vibrations where atoms move in phase.
- **Optical Modes**: Higher-energy modes where adjacent atoms in the basis move out of phase.

Assuming nearest-neighbor interactions and identical force constants $ C $, we get:

$$
M_1 \ddot{u}_n = C (v_{n} + v_{n-1} - 2 u_n)
$$

$$
M_2 \ddot{v}_n = C (u_{n+1} + u_n - 2 v_n)
$$

We assume traveling wave solutions:

$$
u_n = u\, e^{i(kna - \omega t)}, \quad v_n = v\, e^{i(kna - \omega t)}
$$

Substituting these into the equations yields a system of homogeneous linear equations for $ u $ and $ v $, leading to the **dispersion relation**.


The frequency solutions $ \omega(k) $ show two branches:

### Acoustic Branch

$$
\omega^2 \approx \frac{\frac{1}{2}C a^2 k^2}{M_1 + M_2} \quad \text{(for small $ k $)}
$$

- Both atoms move in phase.
- Represents **long-wavelength sound waves**.

### Optical Branch

$$
\omega^2 \approx \frac{2C}{M_1 M_2}(M_1 + M_2)
$$

- Atoms move **out of phase**.
- Can be excited by **electromagnetic radiation** (especially when atoms are oppositely charged).

At zone boundary $ K_{\text{max}} = \pi/a $:

$$
\omega_1^2 = \frac{2C}{M_1}, \quad \omega_2^2 = \frac{2C}{M_2}
$$

This gives rise to a **frequency gap** in the phonon spectrum.
