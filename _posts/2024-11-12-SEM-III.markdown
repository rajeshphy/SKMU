## Competitive Exam Questions - GATE, NET, JEST, etc.

- The semi-empirical mass formula for the binding energy of nucleus contains a surface
correction term. This term depends on the mass $A$ of the nucleus and is proportional to:

    (A) $A^{-\frac{1}{3}}$ 

    (B) $A^{\frac{1}{3}}$

    (C) $A^{\frac{2}{3}}$

    (D) $A$

    Solution: (C) 

- In the $SU(3)$ quark model, the triplet of mesons $(\pi^+, \pi^0,\pi^-)$ has the Iso-spin $I$ and the Strangeness $S$ equal to:

    (A) $I=1, S=0$

    (B) $I=0, S=0$

    (C) $I=1, S=1$

    (D) $I=0, S=1$

- The deuteron has only one bound state with spin parity $1^+$, isospin $0$, and electric quadrupole moment $0.286 \, \text{efm}^2$. These data suggest that the nuclear forces are having:

    (A) only spin and isospin dependence

    (B) no spin dependence and no tensor components

    (C) spin dependence but no tensor components

    (D) spin dependence along with tensor components
