        "excerpt":"Below is the outline of the lecture on Relativistic Quantum Mechanics, covering the Klein–Gordon equation, Dirac equation, probabilities and current densities, magnetic moment and spin of the electron, and free particle solutions of the Dirac equation. Outline Relativistic QM: Klein – Gordon equation and its merit and demerit, Dirac equation,probabilities and current densities, Magnetic moment and spin of electron, free particlesolution of Dirac equation and interpretation of negative energy states. 15 Lectures  The Klein–Gordon Equation The Klein–Gordon equation is a relativistic wave equation for spin-zero particles. It is given by: \\[\\left( \\Box + \\frac{m^2 c^2}{\\hbar^2} \\right) \\psi = 0\\]where:       \\(\\Box\\) (the d’Alembertian operator) is defined as:\\(\\Box = \\nabla^2 - \\frac{1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2}\\)         \\(\\nabla^2\\) is the Laplace operator, which in three spatial dimensions is: \\[\\nabla^2 = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2}\\]    \\(m\\) is the mass of the particle.  \\(c\\) is the speed of light.      \\(\\hbar\\) (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant:     \\(\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi}\\)where \\(h\\) is the Planck constant.     \\(\\psi\\) is the wave function of the particle.Derivation and Background The Klein–Gordon equation arises from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: \\[E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^2\\]By substituting the quantum mechanical operators for energy \\(E\\) and momentum \\(p\\): \\[E \\rightarrow i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}, \\quad \\mathbf{p} \\rightarrow -i\\hbar \\nabla\\]into the energy-momentum relation, we get: \\[\\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\right)^2 = \\left( -i\\hbar \\nabla \\right)^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4\\]Simplifying this yields: \\[-\\hbar^2 \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} = -\\hbar^2 c^2 \\nabla^2 + m^2 c^4\\]Dividing through by \\(-\\hbar^2\\): \\[\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} - c^2 \\nabla^2 + \\frac{m^2 c^4}{\\hbar^2} = 0\\]Rewriting in a more compact form using the d’Alembertian operator: \\[\\left( \\Box + \\frac{m^2 c^2}{\\hbar^2} \\right) \\psi = 0\\]Applications and Significance   Quantum Field Theory: The Klein–Gordon equation is fundamental in quantum field theory for describing scalar fields and spin-zero particles such as pi-mesons (pions).  Prediction of Antiparticles: The equation predicts the existence of antiparticles, as solutions can have both positive and negative energy.  Historical Context: Independently discovered by Oskar Klein and Walter Gordon in 1926, the Klein–Gordon equation was one of the earliest attempts to formulate a relativistic wave equation.Limitations   Negative Probability Density:          The probability density derived from the Klein-Gordon equation is not always positive-definite, complicating its interpretation as a physical probability distribution.        Inclusion of Negative Energy States:          The equation admits solutions with negative energy, which challenges the straightforward interpretation of these solutions within a single-particle framework.        Inadequate for Particles with Spin:          The Klein-Gordon equation does not account for spin, making it unsuitable for describing fermions, such as electrons, which have non-zero spin.        Unbounded Hamiltonian:          The Hamiltonian associated with the Klein-Gordon equation is not bounded from below, leading to stability issues and necessitating reinterpretation within the framework of quantum field theory.      Dirac Equation The Dirac equation was formulated to address the limitations of the Klein-Gordon equation, specifically to describe spin-1/2 particles and to ensure positive-definite probability densities. Linearizing the Klein-Gordon Equation The Klein-Gordon equation is given by:\\(\\left( \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right) \\psi = 0\\) To derive the Dirac equation, we seek a first-order differential equation in both space and time that would still be consistent with the principles of special relativity. We start with the assumption that the equation should be linear in the first derivatives: \\[\\color{red}{ i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} = \\left( \\alpha \\cdot \\mathbf{p} + \\beta m \\right) \\psi }\\]Here, \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are matrices, and \\(\\mathbf{p} = -i \\hbar \\nabla\\) is the momentum operator. Requirements for Matrices To ensure consistency with special relativity and the correct energy-momentum relation, we require that: \\[E^2 = \\mathbf{p}^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4\\]Square both sides of our proposed equation and taking \\(c=\\hbar=1\\)(natural units): \\[\\left( i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\right)^2 \\psi = \\left( \\alpha \\cdot \\mathbf{p} + \\beta m \\right)^2 \\psi\\]One common representation of dirac matrices \\(\\alpha,\\;\\beta\\) is the Dirac-Pauli representation: \\[\\beta = \\gamma^0 = \\begin{pmatrix} I &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; -I \\end{pmatrix}\\]\\[\\alpha_i = \\gamma^0 \\gamma^i\\]where \\(\\gamma^i\\) are the Dirac gamma matrices. Highlighted section below can be skipped, its just for verification Expanding the right-hand side, we get:$$ - \\hbar^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial t^2} = \\left( \\alpha_i p_i \\alpha_j p_j + \\alpha_i p_i \\beta m + \\beta m \\alpha_j p_j + \\beta^2 m^2 \\right) \\psi $$Using the commutation relations of the matrices \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta\\)$$ \\alpha_i \\alpha_j + \\alpha_j \\alpha_i = 2 \\delta_{ij} I $$$$ \\alpha_i \\beta + \\beta \\alpha_i = 0 $$$$ \\beta^2 = I $$Substituting these back, we get:$$ \\left(  \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} -  \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right) \\psi = 0 $$This reduces to the Klein-Gordon equation, showing that our linear equation is consistent.The Dirac Equation Combining all these and in natural units (\\(\\hbar = c = 1\\)), we get the Dirac equation in the form: \\[i \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} = \\left( \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\cdot \\mathbf{p} + \\beta m \\right) \\psi\\]Rearranging the equation we get \\[\\left[i \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial t} - \\left( \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\cdot \\mathbf{p} + \\beta m \\right) \\right]\\psi=0\\]Multiplying both sides by \\(\\beta\\) and using the relation \\(\\beta^2=I\\) and \\(\\mathbf{p=-i\\nabla}\\) we get \\[\\left[i \\beta \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial t} + \\beta  i\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\nabla} - \\beta^2 m  \\right]\\psi=0\\]Replacing \\(\\beta^2\\) by \\(I\\) and expanding \\(\\mathbf{\\alpha\\cdot\\nabla}\\) we get \\[\\left[i \\beta \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial t} + i\\beta \\left(\\alpha_x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial_x}+\\alpha_y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial_y}+\\alpha_z \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial_z}\\right) - m  \\right]\\psi=0\\]To express the Dirac equation in a covariant form, we introduce the gamma matrices \\(\\gamma^\\mu\\), where \\(\\mu = 0, 1, 2, 3\\).

        "excerpt":"Basic principles and different LASER’s: principles and working of Ruby Laser, He-Ne Laser, Solid state laser, semiconductor laser CO2 LASER and qualitative description of longitudinal and TE- LASER systems, Excimer LASER, Dye LASER, Roman LASER, Plasma recombination LASER. 09 LecturesIntroduction to LASERs   A laser is defined as an optical device that generates an intense beam of light with high coherence and narrow spectral bandwidth. This is achieved through the process of stimulated emission, where an external energy source excites atoms or molecules to a higher energy state. When these excited atoms or molecules return to a lower energy state, they emit photons in phase, leading to the amplification of light. The term “laser” stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation, highlighting its fundamental mechanism of operation.There are two main mechanisms involved in the operation of a laser:       Population Inversion: This is the process where the number of atoms or molecules in an excited state is greater than the number in the ground state. This condition is essential for stimulated emission to occur and for the laser to function effectively.         Stimulated Emission: This is the process where an incoming photon interacts with an excited atom or molecule, causing it to emit a second photon with the same energy, phase, and direction as the incoming photon. This leads to the amplification of light and the generation of a coherent laser beam.   Stimulated emission is the key process that distinguishes lasers from other light sources, such as incandescent bulbs or fluorescent lamps. It is different from spontaneous emission, where an atom or molecule emits a photon randomly and independently of external stimuli. Light-Atom Interaction Process Three processes in which atoms interact with light are given in figure below:  Population Inversion Process We need to create a non-equilibrium situation where more atoms are in a higher-energy state than in a lower-energy state, known as a population inversion. In this situation, the rate of energy radiation by stimulated emission can exceed the rate of absorption, making the system act as a net source of radiation with photon energy E. We achieve population inversion by starting with atoms that have the appropriate excited states. The energy-level diagram for such an atom includes a ground state and three excited states of energies E1, E2, and E3 as given in figure-a:  A laser using a material with these energy levels is called a four-level laser. For laser action, the states with energies E1 and E3 must have short lifetimes of about 10⁻⁸ seconds, while the state with energy E2 must have a long lifetime of about 10⁻³ seconds. This long-lived metastable state can occur due to restrictions imposed by conservation of angular momentum that hinder photon emission. The metastable state is the one we aim to populate. Metastable State: A state of an atom or molecule with a long lifetime due to restrictions on the allowed transitions to lower-energy states.To produce a population inversion, we pump the material to excite the atoms from the ground state into the states of energies E1, E2, and E3 as given in figure-b. In a gas, this can be done by inserting two electrodes into the gas container. When a high voltage is applied to the electrodes, an electric discharge occurs, causing collisions between ionized atoms and electrons that excite the atoms to various energy states. Within about 10⁻⁸ seconds as shown in figure-c, the atoms excited to states E1 and E3 undergo spontaneous photon emission, leaving these states depopulated. Atoms accumulate in the metastable state with energy E2. Although the number of atoms in the metastable state is less than in the ground state, it is much greater than in the nearly unoccupied state of energy E1, resulting in a population inversion of state E2 relative to state E1. The levels E1 and E3 are essential: atoms undergoing spontaneous emission from the E3 level help populate the E2 level, and the presence of the E1 level enables the population inversion.  Types of LASERs 1. Solid State LASERs Solid-state lasers use a solid material as the gain medium. This medium typically consists of a glass or crystalline host material doped with ions that provide the necessary energy states for lasing. Examples of Solid-State Lasers   Ruby Laser  Nd:YAG Laser  Nd:Glass LaserRuby Laser A ruby laser is a type of solid-state laser that uses a synthetic ruby crystal as its gain medium. The first ruby laser was constructed by Theodore H. Maiman in 1960. Construction   The ruby rod, which is 4 cm long and 5 mm in diameter, serves as the laser medium.  Both ends of the rod are highly polished and parallel, with one end partially reflective and the other end fully reflective.  The rod is surrounded by a xenon flash tube, which provides the pumping energy to excite the chromium ions in the ruby. Working Principle   The xenon flash tube emits a burst of light, which excites the chromium ions in the ruby rod to a higher energy state.  These ions then drop to a lower energy state (meta-stable state), where they remain for a relatively long time.  As more ions accumulate in this meta-stable state, a population inversion is achieved.  When an excited ion returns to its ground state, it emits a photon. This photon stimulates other excited ions to emit additional photons, leading to a cascade of stimulated emission.  The emitted photons are reflected back and forth between the two mirrors, amplifying the light with each pass until a coherent beam of light exits through the partially reflective mirror.Drawbacks   Requires high pumping power.  Low efficiency.  Operates in pulsed mode.Applications   Optical photography.  Measurement of plasma properties.  Removal of skin melanin.  Holography.2. Gas LASERs Gas lasers use a gas mixture as the gain medium to produce laser light. The gas mixture can consist of various combinations of noble gases, halogens, and metal vapors, depending on the desired output wavelength and power. Examples of Gas Lasers   He-Ne Laser  CO2 Laser  Argon Ion LaserI. He-Ne Laser The He-Ne laser is a gas laser that uses a mixture of helium and neon gases. It was the first continuous-wave (CW) laser and was developed by Ali Javan and his colleagues in 1960. Construction   A discharge tube containing a mixture of helium and neon gases in the ratio of 10:1.  Mirrors are placed at both ends of the tube, with one fully reflective and the other partially reflective.  The typical length of the discharge tube is 80 cm with a diameter of 1 cm. Working Principle   An electric discharge excites the helium atoms to higher energy levels.  These excited helium atoms collide with neon atoms, transferring energy and exciting the neon atoms to higher energy states.  A population inversion is achieved between certain energy levels of the neon atoms.  The neon atoms emit photons when they return to a lower energy state, producing laser light.  The emitted photons are reflected between the mirrors, amplifying the light through stimulated emission until a coherent beam exits through the partially reflective mirror.Applications   Holography.  Barcode scanning.  Laser printing.  Optical demonstrations in educational settings.II. CO2 LASER The CO₂ laser is a type of gas laser that uses carbon dioxide (CO₂) as the gain medium. It is one of the most powerful and efficient types of lasers and is commonly used for industrial cutting, welding, and medical procedures. Construction   Discharge Tube: The CO₂ laser consists of a gas discharge tube filled with a mixture of carbon dioxide (CO₂), nitrogen (N₂), and helium (He). The typical ratio is CO₂:N₂:He = 1:1:8.  Mirrors: Two mirrors are placed at the ends of the discharge tube, forming an optical resonator. One mirror is fully reflective, while the other is partially reflective, allowing some light to escape as the laser beam.  Electrodes: Electrodes are placed along the discharge tube to create an electric field that excites the gas molecules.  Cooling System: A cooling system is used to dissipate the heat generated during the laser operation.Working Principle   Excitation: When an electric current passes through the discharge tube, it excites the nitrogen molecules to a higher energy state.  Energy Transfer: The excited nitrogen molecules collide with CO₂ molecules, transferring energy and exciting the CO₂ molecules to a higher energy state.  Population Inversion: A population inversion is achieved between the higher energy state (E3) and the lower energy state (E1) of the CO₂ molecules.  Stimulated Emission: CO₂ molecules in the higher energy state return to the lower energy state by emitting photons. These photons stimulate other excited CO₂ molecules to emit more photons of the same wavelength.  Amplification: The emitted photons are reflected back and forth between the mirrors, amplifying the light through stimulated emission until a coherent beam of light exits through the partially reflective mirror.Key Characteristics   Wavelength: The CO₂ laser emits infrared light at a wavelength of 10.6 micrometers (µm).  Efficiency: It has a high efficiency, typically around 10-20%.  Power: Capable of producing continuous wave (CW) or pulsed laser beams with high power output, ranging from a few watts to several kilowatts.Applications   Industrial Cutting and Welding: The high power and precision of CO₂ lasers make them ideal for cutting and welding materials such as metals, plastics, and wood.  Medical Procedures: CO₂ lasers are used in various medical applications, including surgery, dermatology, and dental procedures.  Engraving and Marking: Used for engraving and marking on materials like glass, leather, and ceramics.  Scientific Research: Employed in various scientific experiments and research applications due to their high power and stable output.3. Semiconductor Laser Semiconductor lasers, also known as diode lasers, use semiconductor materials as the gain medium. These lasers are widely used due to their small size, efficiency, and ability to be directly modulated. Examples of Semiconductor Lasers   InP (Indium Phosphide) Laser  GaAs (Gallium Arsenide) LaserConstruction    Active Region: The laser diode has a p-n junction as the active region where the lasing action occurs.  Pumping Mechanism: Electrical current is injected into the p-n junction, causing electrons and holes to recombine and emit photons.  Optical Cavity: The semiconductor material itself forms an optical cavity with reflective surfaces at the ends to provide feedback for the amplification of light.Working Principle 1. Structure of the P-N Junction A semiconductor laser consists of a p-type and an n-type semiconductor material joined together to form a p-n junction. When these two materials are joined, a depletion region is formed at the junction where no free charge carriers (electrons or holes) are present. 2. Forward Biasing the P-N Junction When a forward voltage is applied across the p-n junction (positive voltage to the p-type material and negative to the n-type), electrons from the n-type material and holes from the p-type material are pushed towards the junction. This reduces the width of the depletion region and allows current to flow through the junction. 3. Carrier Injection and Recombination The applied forward voltage causes electrons to be injected into the conduction band of the p-type material and holes into the valence band of the n-type material. At the junction, electrons and holes recombine. This recombination releases energy in the form of photons (light). The process can be described in three steps:   Carrier Injection: Electrons and holes are injected into the active region from the n-type and p-type materials, respectively.  Recombination: In the active region, electrons recombine with holes. Each recombination event releases a photon with energy equal to the bandgap energy of the semiconductor material.  Stimulated Emission: Some of the emitted photons stimulate other electrons to recombine with holes, producing additional photons. This chain reaction results in a significant amplification of light.4. Optical Feedback and Resonance To sustain lasing action, the semiconductor laser has an optical cavity formed by cleaving the semiconductor crystal to create parallel, reflective end faces. These faces act as mirrors, reflecting photons back and forth through the active region. The cavity length is designed such that it supports standing wave patterns of specific wavelengths.   Photon Reflection: Photons emitted due to recombination are reflected back and forth between the mirrors.  Amplification: As photons travel through the active region, they stimulate further recombination events, resulting in the amplification of light.  Coherent Light Emission: When the amplified light reaches a certain intensity, it escapes through the partially reflective mirror at one end of the cavity as a coherent laser beam.5. Threshold Condition For lasing to occur, the gain (amplification) provided by stimulated emission must overcome the losses due to absorption, scattering, and reflection at the mirrors. This condition is known as the threshold condition. The current at which this occurs is called the threshold current.   Below Threshold: Below the threshold current, spontaneous emission dominates, and the device behaves like an LED.  Above Threshold: Above the threshold current, stimulated emission dominates, and the device produces coherent laser light.Key Characteristics   Direct Modulation: The output can be directly modulated by varying the current, making them suitable for telecommunications.  Efficiency: High electrical-to-optical efficiency.  Size: Compact and lightweight, allowing for integration into a variety of electronic devices.Applications   Fiber optic communications.  Laser printers.  Barcode scanners.  Optical data storage (CDs, DVDs).Introduction to Waveguides Waveguides are structures designed to guide electromagnetic waves from one point to another. They are utilized based on the desired operating frequency, power requirements, and acceptable transmission losses. Common types include coaxial cables, two-wire lines, microstrip lines, rectangular waveguides, and optical fibers as shown in figure below.  Longitudinal-Transverse Decompositions To understand wave propagation in waveguides, we use solutions to Maxwell’s equations that describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields along the guiding direction (z) and their confinement in the transverse directions (x, y). The electric and magnetic fields can be represented as: \\[E(x, y, z, t) = E(x, y) e^{j(\\omega t - \\beta z)}\\]\\[H(x, y, z, t) = H(x, y) e^{j(\\omega t - \\beta z)}\\]where \\(\\beta\\) is the propagation wavenumber and \\(\\lambda_g = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta}\\) is the guide wavelength. Decomposition of Fields The fields can be decomposed into transverse and longitudinal components: \\[E(x, y) = E_T(x, y) + \\hat{z}E_z(x, y)\\]\\[H(x, y) = H_T(x, y) + \\hat{z}H_z(x, y)\\]Where the transverse electric field \\(E_T(x, y)\\) can be further decomposed into its x and y components: \\[E_T(x, y) = \\hat{x}E_x(x, y) + \\hat{y}E_y(x, y)\\]Classification of Modes Based on the longitudinal components \\(E_z\\) and \\(H_z\\), modes are classified as:   TEM (Transverse Electric and Magnetic) Modes: \\(E_z = 0\\), \\(H_z = 0\\)  TE (Transverse Electric) Modes: \\(E_z = 0\\), \\(H_z \\neq 0\\)  TM (Transverse Magnetic) Modes: \\(E_z \\neq 0\\), \\(H_z = 0\\)  Hybrid Modes: \\(E_z \\neq 0\\), \\(H_z \\neq 0\\)Advanced LASER Systems Longitudinal LASER Systems Longitudinal LASER systems operate by aligning the optical resonator (cavity) such that the light travels parallel to the cavity’s axis. In these systems, the gain medium is pumped to produce a population inversion, allowing for stimulated emission. The emitted photons travel back and forth between two mirrors at each end of the cavity, amplifying the light through successive passes. The longitudinal modes are determined by the cavity’s length and the refractive index of the gain medium, resulting in discrete frequency modes. These systems are critical for applications requiring high coherence and spectral purity, such as in spectroscopy and communication. Key parameters include the cavity length, the reflectivity of the mirrors, and the gain medium’s properties. Stability and alignment of the optical components are crucial for the effective operation of longitudinal LASER systems. TE-LASER Systems TE (Transverse Electric) LASER systems operate with the electric field component of the light oscillating perpendicular to the direction of propagation within the waveguide or resonator structure. These systems typically involve semiconductor materials and are used in diode lasers, where the active region is sandwiched between two cladding layers with differing refractive indices. This configuration confines the light within the active region and supports transverse electric modes. TE modes are characterized by having no electric field component in the direction of propagation (z-axis), which means the electric field lies entirely in the transverse plane (x, y). TE LASER systems are essential in applications requiring compact, efficient, and high-speed light sources, such as in optical communication, barcode scanning, and laser printing. Their design focuses on optimizing the waveguide structure, material composition, and junction properties to achieve desired performance.

        "excerpt":"The Dirac equation for a free particle is given by: \\[(i \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m) \\psi = 0\\]where \\(\\psi\\) is the Dirac spinor, \\(\\gamma^\\mu\\) are the gamma matrices, \\(\\partial_\\mu\\) denotes the four-gradient, and \\(m\\) is the mass of the particle. The conjugate of the Dirac spinor \\(\\psi\\) is denoted by \\(\\bar{\\psi} = \\psi^\\dagger \\gamma^0\\). Step-by-Step Derivation       Start with the Dirac Equation: \\[(i \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m) \\psi = 0\\]        Multiply from the left by \\(\\bar{\\psi}\\): \\[\\bar{\\psi} (i \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m) \\psi = 0\\]    This expands to: \\[i \\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi - m \\bar{\\psi} \\psi = 0\\]        Take the Dirac conjugate of the Dirac equation:     The Dirac conjugate of the Dirac equation is: \\[\\psi^{\\dagger} ( -i \\overleftarrow{\\partial_\\mu} \\gamma^{\\mu\\;\\dagger} - m) = 0\\]    Here, \\(\\overleftarrow{\\partial_\\mu}\\) indicates that the derivative acts to the left. Multiplying both sides by \\(\\gamma^0\\) on R.H.S we get \\[\\psi^{\\dagger} ( -i \\overleftarrow{\\partial_t} \\gamma^{0\\;\\dagger} -i \\overleftarrow{\\partial_k} \\gamma^{k\\;\\dagger} - m)\\gamma^0 = 0\\]    and using the property \\(\\gamma^{k \\dagger}=-\\gamma^{k}\\) and \\(\\gamma^0 \\gamma^k=\\gamma^k\\gamma^0\\) and $k\\neq0$ we get \\[\\psi^{\\dagger} ( -i \\overleftarrow{\\partial_t} \\gamma^{0}\\gamma^0 -i \\overleftarrow{\\partial_k} \\gamma^0\\gamma^{k} - m\\gamma^0) = 0\\]    Now using \\(\\psi^{\\dagger}\\overleftarrow{\\partial_t} \\gamma^0=\\partial_t\\bar{\\psi}\\) we get \\[-i \\partial_t\\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^0 -i \\partial_k\\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^k - m\\bar{\\psi}  = 0\\]    In einstein summation form we get \\[-i \\partial_\\mu\\bar{\\psi} \\;\\gamma^\\mu - m\\bar{\\psi}  = 0\\]    Multiplying by \\(\\psi\\) on R.H.S and cancelling negative sign we get \\[i \\partial_\\mu\\bar{\\psi} \\;\\gamma^\\mu\\psi + m\\bar{\\psi}\\psi  = 0\\]        Combine the results:     From steps 2 and 3, we have: \\[i \\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi = m \\bar{\\psi} \\psi\\]    And: \\[i\\partial_\\mu \\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^\\mu \\psi = - m \\bar{\\psi} \\psi\\]        Add the conjugate equation from the original: \\[i \\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi + \\partial_\\mu \\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^\\mu \\psi = 0\\]    This simplifies to: \\[i \\partial_\\mu (\\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^\\mu \\psi) = 0\\]        Define the current density \\(j^\\mu\\):     The current density \\(j^\\mu\\) is defined as: \\[j^\\mu = \\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^\\mu \\psi\\]    Hence, the above equation becomes: \\[\\partial_\\mu j^\\mu = 0\\]  Conclusion The current density conservation equation derived from the Dirac equation is: \\[\\partial_\\mu j^\\mu = 0\\]This equation expresses the conservation of probability current in relativistic quantum mechanics. The four-current \\(j^\\mu = \\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^\\mu \\psi\\) is conserved, indicating that the total probability (or charge) is conserved in the system. Plane Wave Solution of Dirac Equation Sure, let’s start with the plane wave given by \\[\\psi(x^\\mu) = \\begin{pmatrix} u_A \\\\ u_B \\end{pmatrix} e^{-i p_\\mu x^\\mu}\\]where \\(\\begin{pmatrix} u_A \\\\ u_B \\end{pmatrix}\\) is a spinor, and \\(p_\\mu x^\\mu = p^0 x^0 - \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}\\). and use Dirac equation to solve for the spinors \\(u_A\\), \\(u_B\\) and Energy \\(E\\). Here is step by step solution:       Substitute the Plane Wave Solution:     Substitute \\(\\psi(x)\\) into the Dirac equation: \\[(i \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m) \\psi(x) = 0\\]    Applying the derivative \\(\\partial_\\mu\\): \\[\\color{red}{\\partial_\\mu \\psi(x) = -ip_\\mu \\begin{pmatrix} u_A \\\\ u_B \\end{pmatrix} e^{-i p_\\mu x^\\mu}}\\]    Thus, the Dirac equation becomes: \\[\\left[i \\gamma^\\mu (-ip_\\mu) - m\\right] \\begin{pmatrix} u_A \\\\ u_B \\end{pmatrix} e^{-i p_\\mu x^\\mu} = 0\\]    Simplifying, we get: \\[(\\gamma^\\mu p_\\mu - m) \\begin{pmatrix} u_A \\\\ u_B \\end{pmatrix} = 0\\]    which is a Dirac equation in momentum space.         Writing the Dirac Equation in Matrix Form:     The Dirac equation becomes: \\[\\left( \\gamma^0 p^0 - \\gamma^i p^i - m \\right) \\begin{pmatrix} u_A \\\\ u_B \\end{pmatrix} = 0\\]    Expanding the terms, we have: \\[\\color{red}{ \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix}I &amp; 0 \\\\0 &amp; -I\\end{pmatrix} p^0 - \\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; \\sigma^i \\\\-\\sigma^i &amp; 0\\end{pmatrix} p^i - m \\right] \\begin{pmatrix} u_A \\\\ u_B \\end{pmatrix} = 0 }\\]    where the gamma matrices are expanded with the form given by: \\[\\gamma^0 = \\begin{pmatrix}I &amp; 0 \\\\0 &amp; -I\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\gamma^i = \\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; \\sigma^i \\\\-\\sigma^i &amp; 0\\end{pmatrix}\\]    where \\(I\\) is the \\(2 \\times 2\\) identity matrix, and \\(\\sigma^i\\) (with \\(i = 1, 2, 3\\)) are the Pauli matrices: \\[\\sigma^1 = \\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; 1 \\\\1 &amp; 0\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\sigma^2 = \\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; -i \\\\i &amp; 0\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\sigma^3 = \\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 0 \\\\0 &amp; -1\\end{pmatrix}\\]        Substitute the Pauli spin matrices and Simplify:     On simplifying the above matrix we get: \\[\\begin{pmatrix} I(p^0-m) &amp; -\\sigma^i p^i \\\\\\sigma^i p^i &amp; - I(p^0+m)\\end{pmatrix}  \\begin{pmatrix} u_A \\\\ u_B \\end{pmatrix}  = 0\\]    Or, \\[\\begin{pmatrix} I(E-m) &amp; -\\sigma^i p^i \\\\\\sigma^i p^i &amp; - I(E+m)\\end{pmatrix}  \\begin{pmatrix} u_A \\\\ u_B \\end{pmatrix}  = 0\\]    Or, \\[\\begin{pmatrix}E-m &amp; 0 &amp; -p_z &amp; -(p_x-ip_y) \\\\0 &amp; E-m &amp; -(p_x+ip_y) &amp; p_z\\\\p_z &amp; (p_x-ip_y)&amp;-(E+m)&amp;0\\\\(p_x+ip_y) &amp; -p_z &amp;0 &amp;-(E+m)\\end{pmatrix}  \\begin{pmatrix} u_A \\\\ u_B \\end{pmatrix}  = 0\\]  Here, the spinor \\(\\begin{pmatrix} u_A \\\\ u_B \\end{pmatrix}\\) can take four possible form; two for positive energy \\(E=\\sqrt{p^2+m^2}\\) and two for negative energy \\(E=-\\sqrt{p^2+m^2}\\) as:       For Positive energy: \\[u_1=N_1\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\0 \\\\ A_1\\\\B_1 \\end{pmatrix}\\qquad u_2=N_2\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\1 \\\\ A_2\\\\B_2 \\end{pmatrix}\\]    where, \\((A_1,\\;B_1)\\) and \\((A_2,\\;B_2)\\) are \\((\\frac{p_z}{E+m} , \\frac{p_x+i p_y}{E+m})\\) and \\((\\frac{p_x-i p_y}{E+m} , \\frac{-p_z}{E+m})\\) respectively. \\(N_i\\) are normalization constant.         For Negative energy: \\[u_3=N_3\\begin{pmatrix} A_3\\\\B_3 \\\\ 1\\\\0 \\end{pmatrix}\\qquad u_4=N_4\\begin{pmatrix} A_4\\\\B_4 \\\\ 0\\\\1  \\end{pmatrix}\\]    where, \\((A_3,\\;B_3)\\) and \\((A_4,\\;B_4)\\) are \\((\\frac{p_z}{E-m} , \\frac{p_x+i p_y}{E-m})\\) and \\((\\frac{p_x-i p_y}{E-m} , \\frac{-p_z}{E-m})\\) respectively.   Therefore the eigenfunctions corresponding to positive energy states are: \\[\\psi_1(x^\\mu)=u_1e^{-ip_\\mu x^\\mu}\\qquad \\psi_2(x^\\mu)=u_2e^{-ip_\\mu x^\\mu}\\]and for negative energy state the eigenfunctions are: \\[\\psi_3(x^\\mu)=u_3e^{ip_\\mu x^\\mu}\\qquad \\psi_4(x^\\mu)=u_4e^{ip_\\mu x^\\mu}\\]Interpretation of negative energy states To be continued … ","categories": ["lecture"],

Partial Wave Analysis and Phase Shifts The incident plane wave \\[\\phi(\\mathbf{x})=e^{i\\mathbf{k\\cdot x}}\\]can be expanded in terms of spherical harmonics \\(Y_{lm}(\\theta,\\phi)\\) as \\[\\begin{align}e^{i\\mathbf{k\\cdot x}}&amp;=\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\sum_{m=-l}^l C_{lm}\\; j_l(kr)Y_{lm}(\\theta,\\phi)\\end{align}\\]where, \\(j_l(kr)\\) is the spherical Bessel function of the first kind and \\(C_{lm}\\) is the constant. Since a plane wave is symmetric in \\(\\phi\\) coordinate and therefore it is independent of \\(m\\), further at large distances from the scattering source, the behavior of the spherical Bessel function is approximated as \\[\\begin{align}j_l(kr)&amp;\\approx \\frac{\\sin(kr-l\\pi/2)}{kr}\\\\&amp;=\\frac{1}{2ikr}\\left[e^{i(kr-l\\pi/2)}-e^{-i(kr-l\\pi/2)}\\right]\\end{align}\\]therefore the incident plane wave can be written as \\[\\begin{align}e^{i\\mathbf{k\\cdot x}}&amp;=\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty C_l \\; j_l(kr)P_l(\\cos \\theta)\\\\&amp;=\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty\\;C_l\\; j_l(kr)P_l(\\cos \\theta)\\\\&amp;=\\frac{1}{2ik}\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\;C_l\\left[\\frac{e^{i(kr-l\\pi/2)}}{r}-\\frac{e^{-i(kr-l\\pi/2)}}{r}\\right]P_l(\\cos \\theta)\\end{align}\\]where, \\(P_l(\\cos \\theta)\\) is the Legendre polynomial of degree \\(l\\) and \\(C_l=(2l+1)\\;i^l\\). The scattering wavefunction \\(\\psi(\\mathbf{x})\\) can then rewritten in terms of summation of partial waves as \\[\\begin{align}\\psi(\\mathbf{x})&amp;= \\psi(\\mathbf{x})\\\\&amp;=e^{i\\mathbf{k\\cdot x}}+f(\\mathbf{k',k})\\frac{e^{ikr}}{r}\\\\&amp;=\\frac{1}{2ik}\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\;C_l\\left[\\frac{e^{i(kr-l\\pi/2)}}{r}-\\frac{e^{-i(kr-l\\pi/2)}}{r}\\right]P_l(\\cos \\theta)+ f(\\mathbf{k',k})\\frac{e^{ikr}}{r}\\\\\\end{align}\\]We will use the fact that the amplitude of incoming wave is the same as the amplitude of outgoing wave at large distances from the scattering source. Therefore the above equation can be written as summation over two terms by doing phase shifts of outgoing waves inside the summation to incorporate the outgoing term \\(f(\\mathbf{k',k})\\frac{e^{ikr}}{r}\\) as \\[\\begin{align}\\psi(\\mathbf{x})&amp;=\\frac{1}{2ik}\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\;C_l\\left[\\frac{e^{i(kr-l\\pi/2)+2i\\delta_l}}{r}-\\frac{e^{-i(kr-l\\pi/2)}}{r}\\right]P_l(\\cos \\theta)\\\\&amp;=\\frac{1}{2ik}\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\;C_l\\left[\\frac{e^{ikr}}{r}e^{i(2\\delta_l-l\\pi/2)}-\\frac{e^{-i(kr-l\\pi/2)}}{r}\\right]P_l(\\cos \\theta)\\\\&amp;=\\frac{1}{2ik}\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\;C_l\\left[\\frac{e^{ikr}}{r}(-i)^le^{i2\\delta_l}-\\frac{e^{-i(kr-l\\pi/2)}}{r}\\right]P_l(\\cos \\theta)\\\\\\end{align}\\]where, \\(\\delta_l\\) is the phase shift for the \\(l\\)-th partial wave. The scattering amplitude \\(f(\\mathbf{k',k})=f(\\theta)\\) can therefore be calculated from two successive results by comparing the factor of \\(\\frac{e^{ikr}}{r}\\) as \\[\\begin{align}f(\\theta)&amp;= \\frac{1}{2ik}\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\;C_l\\;(-i)^l\\left[e^{i2\\delta_l}-1\\right]P_l(\\cos \\theta)\\\\&amp;= \\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\;C_l\\;(-i)^l\\;\\frac{e^{i2\\delta_l}-1}{2i}P_l(\\cos \\theta)\\\\&amp;= \\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\;C_l\\;(-i)^l\\;\\sin \\delta_l\\;e^{i\\delta_l}P_l(\\cos \\theta)\\\\&amp;=\\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\;(2l+1)\\;(-i)^{2l}\\;\\sin \\delta_l\\;e^{i\\delta_l}P_l(\\cos \\theta)\\\\&amp;=\\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\;(2l+1)\\;\\sin \\delta_l\\;e^{i\\delta_l}P_l(\\cos \\theta)\\\\\\end{align}\\]Therefore the differential scattering cross-section is given by \\[\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega}=\\left| \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\;(2l+1)\\;\\sin \\delta_l\\;e^{i\\delta_l}P_l(\\cos \\theta)\\right|{}^2\\]","categories": ["lecture"],

        "excerpt":"Perturbation theory is a powerful tool in quantum mechanics used to study systems where the Hamiltonian can be separated into a known part \\(H_0\\) and a small perturbation \\(H'\\). The goal is to find approximate solutions to the Schrödinger equation for the full Hamiltonian \\(H = H_0 + H'\\) by treating the perturbation as a small correction to the known system. Time Independent Perturbation Theory: Non-degenerate Case Suppose we have a Hamiltonian \\[H = H_0 + \\lambda H'\\]where \\(\\lambda\\) is a small parameter. The Hamiltonian \\(H_0\\) is the unperturbed Hamiltonian whose eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are known say \\(E_n^{(0)}\\) and \\(\\psi_n^{(0)}\\) respectively. The Hamiltonian \\(H'\\) is the perturbation to the Hamiltonian \\(H_0\\). Now the problem is to find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian \\(H\\).   If the unperturbed Hamiltonian \\(H_0\\) is known, then the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of \\(H\\) can be found by using perturbation theory.  The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of \\(H\\) can be expanded in powers of \\(\\lambda\\).      The eigenvalues of \\(H\\) are given by: \\[E_n = E_n^{(0)} + \\lambda E_n^{(1)} + \\lambda^2 E_n^{(2)} + \\cdots\\]    where \\(E_n^{(0)}\\) are the eigenvalues of \\(H_0\\) and \\(E_n^{(1)}\\) are the first order corrections to the eigenvalues. Similarly, \\(E_n^{(2)}\\) are the second order corrections to the eigenvalues.         The eigenfunctions of \\(H\\) are given by: \\[\\psi_n = \\psi_n^{(0)} + \\lambda \\psi_n^{(1)} + \\lambda^2 \\psi_n^{(2)} + \\cdots\\]    where \\(\\psi_n^{(0)}\\) are the eigenfunctions of \\(H_0\\) and \\(\\psi_n^{(1)}\\) are the first order corrections to the eigenfunctions. Similarly, \\(\\psi_n^{(2)}\\) are the second order corrections to the eigenfunctions.         The first order correction to the eigenvalues is given by: \\[E_n^{(1)} = \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n^{(0)} \\, d\\tau\\]    One gets this by substituting the above expression for \\(E_n\\) into the Schrödinger equation and then projecting the equation onto \\(\\psi_n^{(0)}\\). We will use the fact that \\[\\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} \\psi_n \\, d\\tau = \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} \\psi_n^{(0)} \\, d\\tau = 1\\]    Expanding the Schrödinger equation gives \\[\\begin{align}  \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} (H_0 + \\lambda H') \\psi_n \\, d\\tau &amp;= E_n \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} \\psi_n \\, d\\tau\\\\  \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H_0 \\psi_n \\, d\\tau + \\lambda \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n \\, d\\tau &amp;= E_n \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} \\psi_n^{(0)} \\, d\\tau\\\\  E_n^{(0)} \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} \\psi_n \\, d\\tau + \\lambda \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n \\, d\\tau &amp;= E_n \\\\  E_n^{(0)} \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} \\psi_n^{(0)} \\, d\\tau + \\lambda \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n \\, d\\tau &amp;= E_n^{(0)}+ \\lambda E_n^{(1)}+ \\lambda^2 E_n^{(2)} + \\cdots\\\\  E_n^{(0)}+ \\lambda \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n \\, d\\tau &amp;= E_n^{(0)}+ \\lambda E_n^{(1)}+ \\lambda^2 E_n^{(2)} + \\cdots\\\\  \\lambda \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n \\, d\\tau &amp;= \\lambda E_n^{(1)}+ \\lambda^2 E_n^{(2)} + \\cdots  \\end{align}\\]    Expanding the perturbative term on L.H.S. of the above equation gives \\[\\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n \\, d\\tau =\\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n^{(0)} \\, d\\tau+ \\lambda\\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n^{(1)} \\, d\\tau+ \\lambda^2\\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n^{(2)} \\, d\\tau+ \\cdots\\]    therefore the Schrödinger equation gives     \\(\\lambda\\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n^{(0)} \\, d\\tau+ \\lambda^2\\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n^{(1)} \\, d\\tau+ \\cdots=\\lambda E_n^{(1)}+ \\lambda^2 E_n^{(2)} + \\cdots\\)     we get first order corrections to the eigenvalues as \\[\\boxed{E_n^{(1)} = \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n^{(0)} \\, d\\tau}\\]    First order correction can be calculated as the expression of the eigenfunction \\(\\psi_n^{(0)}\\) is well known and the matrix element of \\(H'\\) can be calculated. The second order correction to the eigenvalues is given by: \\[\\boxed{E_n^{(2)} = \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n^{(1)} \\, d\\tau}\\]    Here the first order correction to the eigenfunction is needed to calculate the second order correction to the eigenvalues.         The first order correction to the eigenfunctions is given by: \\[\\psi_n^{(1)} = \\sum_{m \\neq n} \\frac{\\int\\psi_m^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n^{(0)}d\\tau}{E_n^{(0)} - E_m^{(0)}}\\psi_m^{(0)}\\]    The first order correction to the eigenfunction can be calculated by using the fact that the eigenfunctions of \\(H_0\\) are known and the matrix elements of \\(H'\\) can be calculated. The first order correction to the eigenfunction is calculated by projecting the Schrödinger equation onto the state \\(\\psi_m^{(0)}\\) where \\(m \\neq n\\).   Time Independent Perturbation Theory: Degenerate Case In the degenerate case, we still have the Hamiltonian \\[H = H_0 + \\lambda H'\\]where \\(\\lambda\\) is a small parameter. The unperturbed Hamiltonian \\(H_0\\) has a set of degenerate eigenstates, meaning there are multiple eigenfunctions corresponding to the same eigenvalue \\(E_n^{(0)}\\). Problem Statement The problem is to find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the perturbed Hamiltonian \\(H\\) when the unperturbed Hamiltonian \\(H_0\\) has degenerate eigenstates. Approach For simplicity, assume that \\(H_0\\) has a degenerate eigenvalue \\(E_n^{(0)}\\) with \\(g\\) degenerate states \\(\\psi_{n,1}^{(0)}, \\psi_{n,2}^{(0)}, \\ldots, \\psi_{n,g}^{(0)}\\). We need to account for the mixing of these degenerate states due to the perturbation \\(H'\\). Eigenvalue and Eigenfunction Expansions The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of \\(H\\) can still be expanded in powers of \\(\\lambda\\): \\[E_n = E_n^{(0)} + \\lambda E_n^{(1)} + \\lambda^2 E_n^{(2)} + \\cdots\\]\\[\\psi_n = \\psi_n^{(0)} + \\lambda \\psi_n^{(1)} + \\lambda^2 \\psi_n^{(2)} + \\cdots\\]However, now \\(\\psi_n^{(0)}\\) is a linear combination of the degenerate states: \\[\\psi_n^{(0)} = \\sum_{k=1}^{g} c_k \\psi_{n,k}^{(0)}\\]First Order Correction to the Eigenvalues To find the first order correction to the eigenvalues, we solve the secular equation by considering the matrix elements of \\(H'\\) in the subspace of the degenerate states: \\[H'_{ij} = \\langle \\psi_{n,i}^{(0)} | H' | \\psi_{n,j}^{(0)} \\rangle\\]We need to solve the eigenvalue problem for the matrix \\(H'\\) restricted to the degenerate subspace: \\[\\sum_{j=1}^{g} H'_{ij} c_j = E_n^{(1)} c_i\\]This is equivalent to finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix \\(H'\\) in the degenerate subspace. The eigenvalues of this matrix are the first order corrections \\(E_n^{(1)}\\). First Order Correction to the Eigenfunctions Once the coefficients \\(c_i\\) are found by solving the secular equation, the first order correction to the eigenfunction \\(\\psi_n^{(0)}\\) can be written as: \\[\\psi_n^{(1)} = \\sum_{m \\neq n} \\frac{\\langle \\psi_m^{(0)} | H' | \\psi_n^{(0)} \\rangle}{E_n^{(0)} - E_m^{(0)}} \\psi_m^{(0)}\\]where \\(\\psi_n^{(0)} = \\sum_{k=1}^{g} c_k \\psi_{n,k}^{(0)}\\). Summary       Solve the secular equation for the degenerate subspace: \\[\\sum_{j=1}^{g} H'_{ij} c_j = E_n^{(1)} c_i\\]        Find the first order correction to the eigenvalues by solving the eigenvalue problem for the matrix \\(H'\\) in the degenerate subspace.         Compute the first order correction to the eigenfunctions using: \\[\\psi_n^{(1)} = \\sum_{m \\neq n} \\frac{\\langle \\psi_m^{(0)} | H' | \\psi_n^{(0)} \\rangle}{E_n^{(0)} - E_m^{(0)}} \\psi_m^{(0)}\\]    with \\(\\psi_n^{(0)}\\) expressed as a linear combination of the degenerate states.   Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory is an essential tool in quantum mechanics used to study systems under the influence of a time-varying external force or potential. It provides a way to calculate the probabilities of transitions between different quantum states over time. Basic Concept Consider a quantum system described by a time-independent Hamiltonian \\(\\hat{H}_0\\) with known eigenstates $ \\ket{n} $ and corresponding energies \\(E_n\\): \\[\\hat{H}_0 \\ket{n} = E_n \\ket{n}\\]When a time-dependent perturbation \\(\\hat{V}(t)\\) is applied to the system, the total Hamiltonian becomes: \\[\\hat{H}(t) = \\hat{H}_0 + \\hat{V}(t)\\]The perturbation \\(\\hat{V}(t)\\) is assumed to be small, so it induces transitions between the eigenstates of \\(\\hat{H}_0\\). Perturbation Expansion The state of the system \\(\\ket{\\Psi(t)}\\) evolves according to the Schrödinger equation: \\[i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\ket{\\Psi(t)} = \\hat{H}(t) \\ket{\\Psi(t)}\\]We express the state \\(\\ket{\\Psi(t)}\\) as a superposition of the unperturbed eigenstates: \\[\\ket{\\Psi(t)}= \\sum_n c_n(t) e^{-iE_n t/\\hbar}\\ket{n}\\]Here, \\(c_n(t)\\) are the time-dependent coefficients that give the probability amplitude for the system to be in state \\(\\ket{n}\\) at time \\(t\\). First-Order Approximation In the first-order approximation, the change in the coefficients \\(c_n(t)\\) is given by: \\[c_n^{(1)}(t) = -\\frac{i}{\\hbar} \\int_{t_0}^{t} \\langle n|\\hat{V}(t')|\\Psi(t')\\rangle e^{iE_n t'/\\hbar} dt'\\]If the system starts in state \\(\\ket{m}\\) at \\(t_0\\), we have: \\[c_n^{(1)}(t) = -\\frac{i}{\\hbar} \\int_{t_0}^{t} \\bra{n}\\hat{V}(t')\\ket{m} e^{i(E_n-E_m)t'/\\hbar} dt'\\]This integral allows us to calculate the probability of the system transitioning from state \\(\\ket{m}\\) to state \\(\\ket{n}\\) due to the perturbation. Transition Probability The probability of the system being found in state \\(\\ket{n}\\) at time \\(t\\) is given by \\(P_{m \\to n}(t)\\): \\[P_{m \\to n}(t) = |c_n^{(1)}(t)|^2\\]For a sinusoidal perturbation of the form \\(\\hat{V}(t) = \\hat{V}_0 \\cos(\\omega t)\\), this expression can be further simplified, leading to well-known results such as Fermi’s Golden Rule for transition rates. Sudden Perturbation In exploring time-dependent perturbation theory, we consider the case of fast or “sudden” perturbations. A perturbation is deemed sudden if the transition from one time-independent Hamiltonian \\(\\hat{H}_0\\) to another \\(\\hat{H}'_0\\) occurs over a time much shorter than any natural period of the system. In such cases, perturbation theory becomes irrelevant. If the system is initially in an eigenstate \\(\\ket{n}\\) of \\(\\hat{H}_0\\), its time evolution post-transition follows \\(\\hat{H}'_0\\). The initial state can then be expressed as a sum over the eigenstates of \\(\\hat{H}'_0\\): \\[\\ket{n} = \\sum_{n'} \\ket{n'} \\bra{n'} n \\rangle\\]The key challenge is to ensure that the change is sudden enough, which is determined by estimating the actual time taken for the Hamiltonian to change and the periods of motion associated with the state \\(\\ket{n}\\) and its transitions to neighboring states. Harmonic Perturbations: Fermi’s Golden Rule Consider a system prepared in an initial state \\(\\ket{i}\\) that is perturbed by a periodic harmonic potential \\(V(t) = V e^{-i\\omega t}\\), which is abruptly switched on at \\(t = 0\\). This scenario could represent an atom perturbed by an external oscillating electric field, like an incident light wave. We aim to determine the probability that at some later time \\(t\\), the system is found in state \\(\\ket{f}\\). From first-order perturbation theory, the coefficient \\(c^{(1)}_f(t)\\) is given by: \\[c^{(1)}_f(t) = -\\frac{i}{\\hbar} \\int_{0}^{t} dt' \\bra{f} V \\ket{i} e^{i(\\omega_{fi} - \\omega)t'} = -\\frac{i}{\\hbar} \\bra{f} V \\ket{i} \\frac{e^{i(\\omega_{fi} - \\omega)t} - 1}{i(\\omega_{fi} - \\omega)}\\]The probability of the transition after time \\(t\\) is then: \\[P_{i \\to f}(t) = \\left| c^{(1)}_f(t) \\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} \\left| \\bra{f} V \\ket{i} \\right|^2 \\left( \\frac{\\sin((\\omega_{fi} - \\omega)t/2)}{(\\omega_{fi} - \\omega)/2} \\right)^2\\]By setting \\(\\alpha = (\\omega_{fi} - \\omega)/2\\), the probability becomes: \\[P_{i \\to f}(t) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} \\left| \\bra{f} V \\ket{i} \\right|^2 \\frac{\\sin^2(\\alpha t)}{\\alpha^2}\\]As \\(t\\) approaches infinity, the function asymptotes to a delta function \\(\\pi t \\delta(\\alpha)\\) as shown in figure below, indicating that the likelihood of transition is proportional to the time elapsed. To obtain the transition rate, we divide by \\(t\\): \\[\\boxed{R_{i \\to f}(t) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{P_{i \\to f}(t)}{t} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar^2} \\left| \\bra{f} V \\ket{i} \\right|^2 \\delta(\\omega_{fi} - \\omega)}\\]This result is known as Fermi’s Golden Rule. Although named after Enrico Fermi, much of the foundational work was done by P.A.M. Dirac in an earlier study, who formulated a nearly identical equation involving a constant, the matrix element of the perturbation, and an energy difference.     ","categories": ["lecture"],

        "excerpt":"In the hydrogen atom, the energy levels are determined by the principal quantum number \\(n\\), and for a given \\(n\\), the energy is given by: \\[E_n^{(0)} = -\\frac{13.6 \\, \\text{eV}}{n^2}\\]For \\(n = 2\\), the energy level is: \\[E_2^{(0)} = -\\frac{13.6 \\, \\text{eV}}{4} = -3.4 \\, \\text{eV}\\]This level is four-fold degenerate because there are multiple quantum states with the same energy. The states are specified by the quantum numbers \\(n\\), \\(l\\), and \\(m_l\\), where:   \\(n\\) is the principal quantum number,  \\(l\\) is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, which can take values from \\(0\\) to \\(n-1\\),  \\(m_l\\) is the magnetic quantum number, which can take values from \\(-l\\) to \\(l\\).For \\(n = 2.\\)  \\(l\\) can be \\(0\\) (s-orbital) or \\(1\\) (p-orbital):   For \\(l = 0\\), \\(m_l = 0\\).  For \\(l = 1\\), \\(m_l = -1, 0, 1\\).Thus, the ( n = 2 ) level has the following four degenerate states:   $ \\ket{2,0,0}$ (2s state)  $ \\ket{2,1,0}$ (2p state)  $ \\ket{2,1,1}$ (2p state)  $ \\ket{2,1,-1}$ (2p state)These states are degenerate in the absence of an external electric field. In presence of electric field they split as shown in figure given below:  Perturbation: The Stark Effect When an external electric field \\(\\mathcal{E}\\) is applied along the \\(z\\)-axis, the Hamiltonian is perturbed: \\[H = H_0 + \\lambda H'\\]where \\(H_0\\) is the unperturbed Hamiltonian, \\(\\lambda\\) is a small parameter, and \\(H'\\) is the perturbation due to the electric field. The perturbation Hamiltonian \\(H'\\) is: \\[H' = e\\mathcal{E}z\\]In spherical coordinates, \\(z = r\\cos\\theta\\), so: \\[H' = e\\mathcal{E}r\\cos\\theta\\]The task is to find the first-order corrections to the energy levels and eigenfunctions due to this perturbation. Matrix Elements of the Perturbation To find the corrections, we need to calculate the matrix elements of \\(H'\\) in the subspace of the degenerate states. The degenerate states for \\(n = 2\\) are: \\[\\psi_{200}^{(0)}, \\, \\psi_{211}^{(0)}, \\, \\psi_{210}^{(0)}, \\, \\psi_{21-1}^{(0)}\\]where:   \\(\\psi_{200}^{(0)}\\) is the 2s state.  \\(\\psi_{211}^{(0)}\\), \\(\\psi_{210}^{(0)}\\), \\(\\psi_{21-1}^{(0)}\\) are the 2p states.The matrix elements $H’_{ij} = \\brakett{\\psi_i^{(0)}}{H’}{\\psi_j^{(0)}}$ are:   \\[H'_{11} = \\brakett{\\psi_{200}^{(0)}}{e\\mathcal{E}z}{\\psi_{200}^{(0)}} = 0\\;\\text{(due to parity)}\\]    \\[H'_{12} = \\brakett{\\psi_{200}^{(0)}}{e\\mathcal{E}z}{\\psi_{211}^{(0)}}\\]    \\[H'_{13} = \\brakett{\\psi_{200}^{(0)}}{e\\mathcal{E}z}{\\psi_{210}^{(0)}}\\]    \\[H'_{14} = \\brakett{\\psi_{200}^{(0)}}{e\\mathcal{E}z}{\\psi_{21-1}^{(0)}}\\]    \\[H'_{22} = \\brakett{\\psi_{211}^{(0)}}{e\\mathcal{E}z}{\\psi_{211}^{(0)}}\\]    \\[H'_{33} = \\brakett{\\psi_{210}^{(0)}}{e\\mathcal{E}z}{\\psi_{210}^{(0)}}\\]    \\[H'_{44} = \\brakett{\\psi_{21-1}^{(0)}}{e\\mathcal{E}z}{\\psi_{21-1}^{(0)}}\\]  These elements need to be calculated. For simplicity, we consider the known spherical harmonics and radial functions. Calculating Matrix Elements The matrix elements for the 2s and 2p states involve the radial part \\(R_{nl}\\) and the angular part \\(Y_{lm}\\). For \\(n = 2\\):   Radial Part:          \\(R_{20}(r)\\) for 2s state      \\(R_{21}(r)\\) for 2p states        Angular Part:          \\(Y_{00}\\) for \\(l = 0, m = 0\\)      \\(Y_{1m}\\) for \\(l = 1, m = -1, 0, 1\\)      For the Stark effect, the relevant spherical harmonics are: \\[Y_1^0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4\\pi}} \\cos\\theta\\]\\[Y_1^{\\pm1} = \\mp\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{8\\pi}} \\sin\\theta e^{\\pm i\\phi}\\]Non-Zero Matrix Elements Using these, we find the non-zero matrix elements: \\[H'_{13} = \\langle \\psi_{200}^{(0)} | e\\mathcal{E}z | \\psi_{210}^{(0)} \\rangle = e\\mathcal{E} \\langle 200 | r\\cos\\theta | 210 \\rangle\\]The radial part can be computed as: \\[\\int_0^\\infty r^3 R_{20} R_{21} \\, dr\\]And the angular part: \\[\\int Y_{00} \\cos\\theta Y_{10} \\, d\\Omega\\]Combining these gives: \\[H'_{13} = e\\mathcal{E} \\left( \\frac{3a_0}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4\\pi}} \\int_0^\\infty r^3 R_{20} R_{21} \\, dr\\]Solving the Secular Equation We construct the perturbation matrix \\(H'\\) in the subspace of the \\(n = 2\\) states and solve the secular equation: \\[\\begin{vmatrix}H'_{11} - E^{(1)} &amp; H'_{12} &amp; H'_{13} &amp; H'_{14} \\\\H'_{21} &amp; H'_{22} - E^{(1)} &amp; H'_{23} &amp; H'_{24} \\\\H'_{31} &amp; H'_{32} &amp; H'_{33} - E^{(1)} &amp; H'_{34} \\\\H'_{41} &amp; H'_{42} &amp; H'_{43} &amp; H'_{44} - E^{(1)}\\end{vmatrix} = 0\\]Since only \\(H'_{13}=\\;H'_{31}=-3e \\mathcal{E} a_0\\) term is non-zero therefore we have \\[\\begin{vmatrix} - E^{(1)} &amp; 0 &amp; -3e \\mathcal{E} a_0 &amp; 0 \\\\0 &amp;  - E^{(1)} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\-3e \\mathcal{E} a_0 &amp; 0 &amp;  - E^{(1)} &amp; 0 \\\\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp;  - E^{(1)}\\end{vmatrix} = 0\\]where \\(a_0\\) is the Bohr radius. Given the symmetry and properties of the hydrogen atom, we find that the first-order energy corrections \\(E_{2,m}^{(1)}\\) are: \\[E_{2,m}^{(1)} = \\pm 3e \\mathcal{E} a_0\\]Conclusion An external electric field lifts the degeneracy of the \\(n = 2\\) level in the hydrogen atom, splitting it into distinct energy levels.

        "excerpt":" Rate Equations for a Three-Level Laser System A three-level laser system operates using the principle of stimulated emission of radiation. The rate equations describe how the populations of various energy levels change under the influence of pumping and laser radiation. The goal is to achieve population inversion, which is necessary for laser action. The Three-Level System In a three-level laser system, atoms or molecules transition between three distinct energy levels:   Ground State (Level 1, $E_1$): The initial state with the population $N_1$.  Excited State (Level 3, $E_3$): The state to which atoms are pumped from the ground state, with the population $N_3$.  Metastable State (Level 2, $E_2$): A relatively stable excited state where population inversion occurs, with the population $N_2$.  Pumping Transition (1 → 3): Atoms are pumped from the ground state (1) to the excited state (3).  Lasing Transition (2 → 1): Atoms transition from the metastable state (2) to the ground state (1), emitting laser radiation.  Rapid Decay (3 → 2): Atoms in state (3) quickly decay to state (2) through nonradiative processes.Rate Equations Let $N_1$, $N_2$, and $N_3$ be the populations of levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The total number of atoms per unit volume is: $N = N_1 + N_2 + N_3$   Population Rate of Level 3 (Excited State):$\\frac{dN_3}{dt} = W_p (N_1 - N_3) - N_3 T_{32}$   $W_p N_1$ represents the rate of induced absorption for the 1 → 3 transition.  $W_p N_3$ represents the rate of stimulated emission for the 3 → 1 transition.  $T_{32} = A_{32} + S_{32}$ is the total relaxation rate from level 3 to level 2, where:          $A_{32}$ is the Einstein A coefficient for spontaneous emission.      $S_{32}$ is the nonradiative transition rate.        Population Rate of Level 2 (Metastable State):$\\frac{dN_2}{dt} = W_l (N_1 - N_2) + N_3 T_{32} - N_2 T_{21}$   $W_l (N_1 - N_2)$ represents the stimulated transitions between levels 1 and 2 (2 → 1 lasing).  $N_3 T_{32}$ represents the spontaneous transitions from level 3 to level 2.  $N_2 T_{21}$ represents the spontaneous transitions from level 2 to level 1.  $W_l$ is proportional to the Einstein B coefficient $B_{21}$ and the energy density of the lasing transition.  $T_{21} \\approx A_{21}$ represents the spontaneous relaxation rate from level 2 to level 1.  Population Rate of Level 1 (Ground State):$\\frac{dN_1}{dt} = W_p (N_3 - N_1) + W_l (N_2 - N_1) + N_2 T_{21}$   $W_p (N_3 - N_1)$ represents the net stimulated transitions between levels 1 and 3.  $W_l (N_2 - N_1)$ represents the stimulated transitions between levels 1 and 2.  $N_2 T_{21}$ represents the spontaneous transitions from level 2 to level 1.  Conservation of Population:$\\frac{dN_1}{dt} + \\frac{dN_2}{dt} + \\frac{dN_3}{dt} = 0$ Equations (2), (4), and (5) are referred to as the rate equations for a three-level laser system. Steady-State Solutions At steady state, the time derivatives of the populations are zero: $\\frac{dN_1}{dt} = 0, \\quad \\frac{dN_2}{dt} = 0, \\quad \\frac{dN_3}{dt} = 0$   For Level 3:$N_3 = \\frac{W_p}{W_p + T_{32}} N_1$   For Level 2:$N_2 = \\frac{W_l + \\frac{T_{32} W_p}{W_p + T_{32}}}{W_l + T_{21}} N_1$   Population Difference Between Levels 2 and 1:$\\frac{N_2 - N_1}{N} = \\frac{W_p (T_{32} - T_{21}) - T_{32} T_{21}}{3W_p W_l + 2W_p T_{21} + 2T_{32} W_l + T_{32} W_p + T_{32} T_{21}}$ Condition for Population Inversion To achieve population inversion between levels 2 and 1 ($N_2 &gt; N_1$), a necessary condition is: $T_{32} &gt; T_{21}$   The relaxation rate from level 3 to level 2 must be greater than that from level 2 to level 1.  The lifetime of level 3 must be shorter than that of level 2.Minimum Pumping Rate for Population Inversion A minimum pumping rate $W_p$ is required to maintain population inversion: $W_{p,\\text{min}} = \\frac{T_{32} T_{21}}{T_{32} - T_{21}}$ For population inversion to occur, the actual pumping rate $W_p$ must be greater than $W_{p,\\text{min}}$.

Weak Nuclear Force:          Responsible for beta decay, where a neutron transforms into a proton, emitting an electron and a neutrino.      The weak force is weaker than the strong force, which is why beta decay is common but requires much less energy than breaking the strong force to split the nucleus.      Yukawa’s Meson Hypothesis In 1935, Hideki Yukawa proposed the existence of a new particle to mediate the strong nuclear force, similar to how photons mediate the electromagnetic force. This particle, later identified as the pion (π-meson), would account for the short-range nature of the nuclear force binding protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus. Yukawa’s hypothesis revolutionized our understanding of nuclear interactions and provided a foundational step in particle physics. Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and Particle Mass Estimation Yukawa’s approach involved utilizing the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states: $\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\approx \\hbar$ where $\\Delta E$ is the energy uncertainty, $\\Delta t$ is the time interval over which this uncertainty applies, and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck’s constant. The energy-time uncertainty relationship suggests that a particle can temporarily “borrow” energy $\\Delta E$ for a brief period $\\Delta t$, creating a “virtual particle” that mediates interactions over short distances. For a particle moving at nearly the speed of light, the time $\\Delta t$ can be estimated based on the range of the strong nuclear force, roughly 1 fermi ($1 \\ \\text{fm} = 10^{-15} \\ \\text{m}$). Problem Statement Given the range of the strong nuclear force as approximately 1 fermi ($10^{-15} \\ \\text{m}$), calculate the approximate mass of the pion assuming it moves at nearly the speed of light. Solution: Using the steps outlined below, calculate $\\Delta t$, then find $\\Delta E$ using the uncertainty principle, and finally convert this energy into the mass of the pion. Calculation of the Pion Mass To estimate the mass of the pion that carries the strong nuclear force, we can use the uncertainty principle and consider the approximate range of nuclear forces:       Step 1: Determine $\\Delta t$     Since the pion mediates the strong force over a distance $r \\approx 1 \\ \\text{fm}$, we approximate $\\Delta t$ as:     $\\Delta t \\approx \\frac{r}{c}$     where $c$ is the speed of light.         Step 2: Calculate $\\Delta E$     By the uncertainty principle, we have:     $\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{\\hbar c}{r}$         Step 3: Find the Mass of the Pion     This energy $\\Delta E$ corresponds to the mass of the pion (or meson) using Einstein’s equation $E = mc^2$:     $m_\\pi \\approx \\frac{\\Delta E}{c^2} = \\frac{\\hbar}{r c}$   Substituting known values ($\\hbar c \\approx 197 \\ \\text{MeV fm}$, $r \\approx 1 \\ \\text{fm}$): $m_\\pi \\approx \\frac{197 \\ \\text{MeV fm}}{1 \\ \\text{fm} \\cdot c} \\approx 197 \\ \\text{MeV}/c^2$ Thus, Yukawa predicted the mass of the pion to be approximately 200 times the mass of the electron, which aligns with the observed pion mass in nature.

        "title": "Particle Physics: Particle Classification",
        "excerpt":"Japanese physicist Hideki Yukawa proposed in 1935 that the nuclear force is mediated by a new particle, a meson, whose exchange between nucleons causes the force. He predicted its mass to be about 200 times that of an electron, earning him a Nobel Prize in 1949. Because the new particle would have a mass between that of the electron and that of the proton, it was called a meson (from the Greek meso, “middle”)   Note: (Yukawa’s predicted particle is not the gluon as previously mentioned, which is massless and is today considered to be the field particle for the nuclear force.)In modern physics, particle interactions are explained through the exchange of field particles (or gauge bosons). These particles are emitted and absorbed by interacting particles, creating forces. The electromagnetic force is mediated by photons, the nuclear force by gluons, the weak force by W and Z bosons, and the gravitational force by gravitons. The interactions, their ranges, and relative strengths are summarized in the table below.

In 1937, Carl Anderson discovered a particle approximately 207 times the mass of electron, initially thought to be Yukawa’s meson. However, it interacted weakly with matter and was later identified as a muon, participating in weak and electromagnetic interactions. Yukawa’s prediction was validated in 1947 with the discovery of the pi meson (pion), which exists in three charge states: $\\pi^+$, $\\pi^-$, and $\\pi^0$, with masses around $140 \\, \\text{MeV}/c^2$. Two muons exist $\\mu^+$ and its antiparticle $\\mu^-$. Both pions and muons are highly unstable and decay into lighter particles. For example, The $\\pi^-$, which has a mean lifetime of $2.6 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{s}$, decays to a muon and an antineutrino: $\\pi^- \\to \\mu^- + \\bar{\\nu}$ The muon, with a mean lifetime of $2.2 \\, \\mu\\text{s}$, subsequently decays into an electron, a neutrino, and an antineutrino: $\\mu^- \\to e^- + \\nu + \\bar{\\nu}$ Particle Classification We’ve learned about pions and muons. We have a growing list of particles(more than 300). Apart from field particles, all particles fall into two main groups: hadrons and leptons. Hadrons Particles that interact through the strong force (as well as through the other fundamental forces) are called hadrons. The two classes of hadrons, mesons and baryons, are distinguished by their masses and spins.   Mesons have zero or integer spin (0 or 1). Yukawa proposed their mass to lie between that of the electron and proton. While several mesons fall in this range, others with greater mass than the proton have also been discovered. Mesons eventually decay into electrons, positrons, neutrinos, and photons. The pions are the lightest known mesons.  Baryons, the second class of hadrons, have masses equal to or greater than the proton mass, and their spin is always a half-integer value (1/2, 3/2, …). Protons and neutrons are examples of baryons, as are many others. Except for the proton, all baryons decay to produce a proton.It is now believed that hadrons are not elementary particles but are made up of more fundamental units called quarks. Leptons Leptons (from the Greek leptos, meaning “small” or “light”) are particles that do not interact via the strong force. All leptons have spin 1/2. Unlike hadrons, which have size and structure, leptons are considered truly elementary, meaning they have no internal structure and are point-like. The table below lists the known leptons and Hadrons along with their properties.  ","categories": ["lecture"],

        "title": "Particle Physics: Conservation Laws",
        "excerpt":"The conservation laws of energy, momentum, and charge govern all processes. In particle physics, additional empirical conservation laws are also crucial. They are:   Conservation of baryon number  Conservation of lepton number  Conservation of strangeness  Conservation of isospin  Conservation of electric chargeBaryon Number and Lepton Number   Experimental results show that whenever a baryon is created in a decay or nuclearreaction, an antibaryon is also created. This scheme can be quantified by assigning every particle a quantum number, the baryon number, as follows: $B=+1$ forall baryons, $B=-1$ for all antibaryons, and $B=0$ for all other particles.The law of conservation of baryon number states that    Whenever a nuclear reaction or decay occurs, the sum of the baryon numbers before the process must equal the sum of the baryon numbers after the process.        The conservation of lepton number is similar to the conservation of baryon number. The lepton number is defined as $L=+1$ for all leptons, $L=-1$ for all antileptons, and $L=0$ for all other particles.

A group of these—thekaon $k$, lambda $\\Lambda$ and sigma $\\Sigma$ particles—exhibited unusual propertiesboth as they were created and as they decayed; hence, they were called strangeparticles.   One unusual property of strange particles is that they are always produced in    pairs.For example, when a pion collides with a proton, a highly probable result isthe production of two neutral strange particles: \\[\\pi^- + p \\rightarrow \\Lambda^0 + K^0\\]  The second peculiar feature of strange particles is that although they are produced in reactions involving the strong interaction at a high rate, they do not decay into particles that interact via the strong force at a high rate. Instead, they decay very slowly, which is characteristic of the weak interaction. Their half-lives are in the range $10^{-10}$ s to $10^{-8}$ s, whereas most other particles that interact via the strong force have much shorter lifetimes on the order of $10^{-23}$ s.To explain these unusual properties of strange particles, a new quantum number S, called strangeness, was introduced, together with a conservation law. The production of strange particles in pairs is handled mathematically by assigning $S = +1$ to one of the particles, $S = -1$ to the other, and $S = 0$ to all non-strange particles. The law of conservation of strangeness states that In a nuclear reaction or decay that occurs via the strong force, strangeness is conserved; that is, the sum of the strangeness numbers before the process must equal the sum of the strangeness numbers after the process. In processes that occur via the weak interaction, strangeness may not be conserved.Assignments       Whether this reaction can occur: $\\pi^- + p \\rightarrow p + K^0$         Use the law of strangeness conservation to determine whether the reaction $\\pi^0+n\\rightarrow K^++\\Sigma^+$ occurs.

        "title": "Particle Physics: Quarks",
        "excerpt":" Scientists use patterns in data to understand natural phenomena, such as differences in the specific heat of gases, ionization energy levels, and nuclear binding energy. One of the most significant examples is the periodic table, which explains the behavior of over 100 elements formed from just protons, neutrons, and electrons. Inspired by the periodic table, physicists have sought patterns to classify the hundreds of observed particles. Baryons with spin $\\frac{1}{2}$ and spin-zero mesons, for instance, can be grouped based on properties like strangeness $\\mathbf{S}$ and charge $\\mathbf{Q}$. The Eightfold Way (Gell-Mann named the patterns the Eightfold Way after the Eightfold Path to nirvana in Buddhism), developed by Murray Gell-Mann and Yuval Ne’eman in 1961, is one such classification scheme. The figure at the top shows the Eightfold Way classification for baryons on the left and mesons on the right. Is it possible that a small number of entities exist from which all these particles can be built?. The existence of the strangeness–charge patterns of the eightfold way suggests that hadrons have substructure. Furthermore, hundreds of types of hadrons exist and many decay into other hadrons. In 1963, Gell-Mann and George Zweig independently proposed a model for the substructure of hadrons. According to their model, all hadrons are composed of two or three elementary constituents called quarks. The model has three types of quarks, designated by the symbols $u$, $d$, and $s$, that are given the arbitrary names up, down, and strange. The figure below shows the quark compositions for mesons and baryons. The various types of quarks are called flavors.     An unusual property of quarks is that they carry a fractional electric charge. The $u$, $d$, and $s$ quarks have charges of $\\frac{2}{3}e$, $-\\frac{1}{3}e$, and $-\\frac{1}{3}e$, respectively, where $e$ is the elementary charge $1.602 × 10^{-19}\\; C$. These and other properties of quarks and antiquarks are given in Table below.     The compositions of all hadrons known when Gell-Mann and Zweig presented their model can be completely specified by three simple rules:   A meson consists of one quark and one antiquark, giving it a baryon number of 0, as required.  A baryon consists of three quarks.  An antibaryon consists of three antiquarks.Charm, Bottom, and Top Quarks The original quark model, which included the up, down, and strange quarks, encountered limitations when explaining certain experimental decay rates and particle properties. This led to the proposal of a fourth quark flavor, charm ($c$), in 1967. The charmed quark, like the up quark, carries a charge of $+\\frac{2}{3}e$ but is distinguished by a quantum number called charm $C$, with the charmed quark having $C = +1$ and its antiquark having $C = -1$. Experimental evidence for the charm quark emerged in 1974 with the discovery of the $\\psi$ meson ($c\\bar{c}$), a particle significantly more massive and longer-lived than other mesons, leading to the Nobel Prize for Burton Richter and Samuel Ting in 1976. In 1977, the discovery of a new heavy meson, the upsilon ($\\Upsilon$), at Fermilab confirmed the existence of the bottom ($b$) quark. The bottom quark has a charge of $-\\frac{1}{3}e$ and is associated with the quantum number bottomness, analogous to charm. Finally, the top ($t$) quark, the heaviest of all quarks with a mass of approximately $173 \\ \\text{GeV}/c^2$, was discovered in 1995 at Fermilab. The top quark also carries a charge of $+\\frac{2}{3}e$. Together with their antiquarks, these flavors complete the six-quark model. These quarks interact via the strong force, mediated by gluons, and are never observed in isolation due to confinement. Instead, they combine to form mesons (quark-antiquark pairs) and baryons (three-quark combinations). Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) describes their interactions, with color charge playing a crucial role in ensuring the stability and properties of hadrons. Note: Quarks have never been observed in isolation due to their confinement by the strong force, which increases with distance, similar to a stretched spring. Efforts to create a quark–gluon plasma, where quarks are liberated from protons and neutrons, have shown progress. In 2000, CERN reported evidence of such a plasma from lead nucleus collisions.

Note: Semiconductors are materials that act as insulators at low temperatures, but as conductors when energy or heat is available.At present, most solar cells are silicon-based, since this is the most mature technology. However, other materials are under active investigation and may supersede silicon in the long term. The electrical properties of semiconductors can be explained using two models, the bond and the band models.   The bond model uses the covalent bonds joining the silicon atoms to describe semiconductor behaviour. At low temperatures, silicon acts as an insulator because the bonds are intact. At high temperatures, some bonds break, allowing conduction through two processes:          Electrons from broken bonds are free to move.      Electrons from neighboring bonds can move into the ‘hole’ created by the broken bond, causing the hole to propagate as if it had a positive charge.         The band model describes semiconductor behaviour in terms of the energy levels between valence and conduction bands. The electrons in covalent bonds have energies corresponding to those in the valenceband. In the conduction band the electrons are free. The forbidden gap corresponds to the minimum energy needed to release an electron from a covalent bond to the conducting band where it can conduct a current. The holes remaining conduct in the opposite direction in the valence band, as described for the bond model. Doping It is possible to shift the balance of electrons and holes in a silicon crystal lattice by ‘doping’ it with other atoms. Atoms with one more valence electron than the semiconductor are used to produce ‘n-type’ material. Atoms with one less valence electron result in ‘p-type’ material. The digram below shows the classification of semiconductors based on doping. graph TD    A[Semiconductors] --&gt; B[Intrinsic Semiconductors]    A --&gt; C[Extrinsic Semiconductors]    C --&gt; D[n-type]    C --&gt; E[p-type]    B --&gt; F(Example: Sillicon, Germanium, etc.)    D --&gt; G(Dopants: Phosphorus, Arsenic, etc.)    E --&gt; H(Dopants: Boron, Aluminium, etc.)    style F fill:#d3f9d8,stroke:#009900,stroke-width:2px    style G fill:#d3f9d8,stroke:#009900,stroke-width:2px    style H fill:#d3f9d8,stroke:#009900,stroke-width:2px  Intrinsic Semiconductors: Pure semiconductors are called intrinsic semiconductors. They are made of silicon or germanium. They have equal numbers of electrons and holes.  Extrinsic Semiconductors: Semiconductors doped with impurities are called extrinsic semiconductors. They are of two types: n-type and p-type.PN Junction A PN junction is formed by joining a p-type and an n-type semiconductor. The junction has a depletion region where the electrons and holes have combined, leaving behind immobile ions. The depletion region acts as an insulator, preventing current flow. When a voltage is applied across the junction, the depletion region narrows, allowing current to flow. The junction is used in diodes, transistors, and solar cells. Figure below shows the formation of a PN junction.      Mechanism of Formation of PN Junction: When a p-type semiconductor and an n-type semiconductor are brought into contact, electrons from the n-type region diffuse into the p-type region and recombine with holes. Similarly, holes from the p-type region diffuse into the n-type region and recombine with electrons. This diffusion process continues until a depletion region is formed at the junction, where no free charge carriers are present. The immobile ions left behind create an electric field that opposes further diffusion of charge carriers. This electric field establishes a built-in potential barrier that must be overcome for current to flow across the junction. When an external voltage is applied, it can either widen or narrow the depletion region, allowing or preventing current flow, respectively. Based on the voltage applied, the PN junction can be classified into three modes of operation:   Forward Bias: When the positive terminal of the battery is connected to the p-type region and the negative terminal to the n-type region, the depletion region narrows, allowing current to flow. This is the forward bias mode.  Reverse Bias: When the positive terminal of the battery is connected to the n-type region and the negative terminal to the p-type region, the depletion region widens, preventing current flow. This is the reverse bias mode.  Zero Bias: When no external voltage is applied, the depletion region remains constant, and no current flows. This is the zero bias mode.     The operation of a junction as a diode is best understood in terms of the potential difference graph shown at the bottom of Figure-(a,b,c) above. When a voltage $\\Delta V$ is applied to the junction such that the $p$-side is connected to the positive terminal of a voltage source (as shown in Figure-a), the internal potential difference $\\Delta V_0$ across the junction decreases, as illustrated at the bottom of the figure. This decrease results in a current that increases exponentially with increasing forward voltage (or forward bias). In the case of reverse bias—where the $n$-side of the junction is connected to the positive terminal of a voltage source—the internal potential difference $\\Delta V_0$ increases with increasing reverse bias, as shown in Figure-b. This increase leads to a very small reverse current that quickly reaches a saturation value, $I_0$. The current–voltage relationship for an ideal diode is given by the equation: $I = I_0 \\left(e^{\\frac{e \\Delta V}{k_B T}} - 1\\right)$, where the first $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm, the second $e$ represents the magnitude of the electron charge, $k_B$ is Boltzmann’s constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Figure-c shows an $I$–$\\Delta V$ plot characteristic of a real $p$–$n$ junction, demonstrating its one-way valve behavior.

        "title": "Nuclear Reactions",
        "excerpt":"Nuclear reactions can occur when a target nucleus $X$ is bombarded by a particle $a$, resulting in a daughter nucleus $Y$ and an outgoing particle $b$: \\[a + X \\rightarrow Y + b\\]The reaction energy $Q$ in a nuclear reaction represents the difference between the initial and final rest energies of the participating nuclei. Mathematically, it is given by: \\[Q = (M_a + M_X - M_b - M_Y)c^2\\]where $M_a$ and $M_X$ are the masses of the reactants, $M_b$ and $M_Y$ are the masses of the products, and $c$ is the speed of light. A positive $Q$-value indicates an exothermic reaction, where energy is released. For example, in the reaction: \\(\\ce{^1_1H + ^7_3Li -&gt; ^4_2He + ^4_2He}\\) , the $Q$-value is $Q = 17.3 \\, \\mathrm{MeV}$. Such reactions often release energy in the form of kinetic energy of the products, making them energetically favorable. Conversely, a negative $Q$-value corresponds to an endothermic reaction, where energy must be supplied for the reaction to occur. For an endothermic reaction, the bombarding particle must have kinetic energy greater than the magnitude of $Q$. This minimum energy required to initiate the reaction is known as the threshold energy, and it ensures conservation of momentum and energy in the isolated system. Problem 1: Q Value Calculation for Alpha Decay of $^{226}\\text{Ra}$ The $^{226}\\text{Ra}$ nucleus undergoes alpha decay according to \\[_{88}^{226}\\text{Ra} \\rightarrow _{86}^{222}\\text{Rn} + _2^4\\text{He}\\]Calculate the Q value for this process using the formula $Q = \\left( M_{\\text{initial}} - M_{\\text{final}} \\right)\\times 931.494 MeV/u$. The masses are:   $226.025408 \\, \\text{u}$ for $_{88}^{226}\\text{Ra}$  $222.017576 \\, \\text{u}$ for $_{86}^{222}\\text{Rn}$  $4.002603 \\, \\text{u}$ for $_2^4\\text{He}$.Problem 2: Energy Released by Fission of 1.00 kg of $^{235}\\text{U}$ Calculate the energy released when 1.00 kg of $^{235}\\text{U}$ undergoes fission, given that the disintegration energy per event is $Q = 208 \\, \\text{MeV}$. Answer:     $5.33\\times10^{26}MeV$ How much is this energy?  The energy released in the fission of 1 kg of $^{235}\\text{U}$, if released slowly, is enough to keep a 100-W lightbulb operating for 30,000 years! If the available fission energy in 1 kg of $^{235}\\text{U}$ were suddenly released, it would be equivalent to detonating about 20,000 tons of TNT. Problem 3: Identifying Unknown Nuclides and Particles Identify the unknown nuclides and particles $X$ and $X’$ in the following nuclear reactions: (a) $X + _2^4\\text{He} \\rightarrow _{12}^{24}\\text{Mg} + _0^1\\text{n}$(b) $ _{92}^{235}\\text{U} + _0^1\\text{n} \\rightarrow _{38}^{90}\\text{Sr} + X + 2( _0^1\\text{n})$(c) $2( _1^1\\text{H}) \\rightarrow  _1^2\\text{H} + X + X’$ Classifications of Nuclear Reactions: Blatt, Weisskopf, and Krane Here we discuss Kenneth Blatt, Weisskopf, and Krane classification which is more specific approach compared to the broader categories of decay and transmutation based on reaction outcomes. A typical nuclear reaction is represented as: \\[a + X \\rightarrow Y + b\\]  a: Accelerated projectile.  X: Target (usually stationary).  Y and b: Reaction products, where Y is typically a heavy particle and b is a light particle that can be detected.Types of Reactions   Scattering Reactions          Occur when incident and outgoing particles are the same.              Elastic scattering: When Y and b are in their ground states. The nucleus does not react to this collision in any way. The video below shows an example of elastic scattering.                               Your browser does not support the video tag.                Inelastic scattering: When Y or b is in an excited state and decays by emitting gamma rays. After collision with a nucleus, the neutron might transfer part of its kinetic energy. The neutron is slowed down, the nucleus is excited by this excess energy and must release it by the emission of a photon or possibly by another change. If the amount of transferred energy is large enough, the nucleus might disintegrate. The video below shows an example of inelastic scattering.                               Your browser does not support the video tag.          Radiative Capture          If b is a gamma ray, in which case the reaction is called radiative capture.      During radiative capture, an incident neutron enters the target nucleus forming a compound nucleus and at the same time transferring all its energy to the nucleus. The nucleus is excited by this additional energy and must release it by emitting a photon, or possibly by another type of change. The video below shows an example of radiative capture.                               Your browser does not support the video tag.          Nuclear Photoeffect          If a is a gamma ray, the reaction is called nuclear photoeffect.        Direct Reactions          Only a few nucleons participate, with others remaining as passive spectators. Direct reactions happen on the surface rather than in the volume of interacting nuclei.      Projectile and target are within the range of nuclear forces for the very short time allowing for an interaction of a single nucleon only. These type of reactions are called the direct reactions.      Direct reactions are well described as a one-step transition from the initial state in the entrance to the final state in the exit channel.      Direct reactions include: stripping, pick-up, and knockout reactions.        Compound Nucleus Reaction          Involves a brief merging of incoming and target nuclei, leading to a complete sharing of energy before the nucleon is ejected.      Characteristics:              The direct reactions involve a single-nucleon interaction and are fast. In contrast, compound nucleus reaction involve many nucleon-nucleon interactions, in fact very many so these collisions lead to a complete thermal equilibrium (equal energy partition between nucleons) inside the compound nucleus.      Since energy equilibration require time, the compound nucleus reaction are significantly slower than direct reactions.              The compound system releases energy by emission of neutrons, protons, $\\alpha$ particles and $\\gamma$-rays, but has a lifetime on the order of $10^{-19} s$. This time may seem short but it is $~$ 1000 times longer than the characteristic time for direct reactions.             The compound nucleus is formed when the projectile and target nuclei merge, and the nucleon is ejected after the compound nucleus has had time to equilibrate. Video below shows an example of the compound nucleus mechanism.                   Your browser does not support the video tag.      Transfer Reactions          Involve the transfer of one or two nucleons between the projectile and the target.              Example: A deuteron incoming and turning into a proton or neutron, adding a nucleon to the target X to form Y.        Resonance Reactions          In these reactions, the incoming particle forms a quasibound state before the outgoing particle is ejected.      Assignments Identify the type of reaction:       $ n + \\ce{^235U} \\to \\ce{^236U^*} \\to \\ce{^92Kr} + \\ce{^141Ba} + 3n $         $ n + \\ce{^10B} \\to \\ce{^11B} + \\gamma $         $ n + \\ce{^10B} \\to \\ce{^11B} + \\gamma $         $ d + \\ce{^14N} \\to p + \\ce{^15N} $         $ p + \\ce{^15N} \\to \\ce{^16O^*} \\to \\alpha + \\ce{^{12}C} $   Compound-Nucleus Reactions   When an incident particle enters a target nucleus with an impact parameter smaller than the nuclear radius, it interacts with one of the nucleons, possibly through scattering.          The recoiling nucleon and incident particle lose energy in successive collisions.      The energy is distributed among the nucleons, with a small probability for a nucleon to gain enough energy to escape, akin to molecules evaporating from a hot liquid.      Symbolic Representation The reaction can be written as:\\(a + X \\to C^* \\to Y + b\\)where \\(C^*\\) is the compound nucleus. In compact form, the reaction is represented as:\\(X(a,b)Y\\)   Two-Step Process:          Formation of the compound nucleus.      Subsequent decay of the compound nucleus.        Key Assumption:The relative probability for decay into specific final products is independent of the formation process.          Decay probability depends only on the total energy, governed by statistical rules.      Example    The compound nucleus \\(^{64}\\text{Zn}^*\\) can be formed by:          \\[p + ^{63}\\text{Cu}\\]            \\[\\alpha + ^{60}\\text{Ni}\\]              Possible decay pathways include:          \\[^{63}\\text{Zn} + n\\]            \\[^{62}\\text{Zn} + 2n\\]            \\[^{62}\\text{Cu} + p + n\\]              Cross-section comparison:If the model holds, reactions like \\(^{63}\\text{Cu}(p,n)^{63}\\text{Zn}\\) and \\(^{60}\\text{Ni}(\\alpha,n)^{63}\\text{Zn}\\) have similar relative cross-sections at incident energies providing the same excitation energy to \\(^{64}\\text{Zn}^*\\).          Observation: Experimental data (Figure-1) supports this model, showing agreement across cross-sections.                            Figure-1:Experimental cross sections for $(p,n)$, $(p, 2n)$, $(p, pn)$ reactions on $Cu^{63}$ and for $(\\alpha, n)$, $(n, 2n)$, $(\\alpha, pn)$ reactions on $Ni^{60}$ are plotted against $E_{p}$ and $E_{\\alpha}$, respectively.           The scale of $E_{p}$ has been shifted by 7 MeV with respect to the scale of $E_{\\alpha}$. Source: S. N. Goshal, Phys. Rev. 80, 939 (1950).              Conditions for the Model and Characteristics   Works best at low incident energies (\\(10-20\\ \\text{MeV}\\)) where the projectile is unlikely to escape intact.  Suitable for medium-weight and heavy nuclei, where the nucleus can absorb the incident energy.Angular Distribution   Due to random nucleon interactions, emitted particles generally exhibit isotropic angular distribution.          Exception: For heavy ions with significant angular momentum transfer, particles may emit preferentially at \\(0^\\circ\\) and \\(180^\\circ\\).                            Figure-2: The curve marked NC shows the contribution from compound-nucleus formation to the cross-section of the reaction: $^{25}\\text{Mg}(p,p)^{25}\\text{Mg}.$ The curve marked ID shows the contribution from direct reactions. The direct part exhibits a strong angular dependence, while the compound-nucleus part shows little angular dependence.  Source: A. Gallmann et al., Nucl. Phys. 88, 654 (1966).    Energy Dependence   The “evaporation” analogy holds:          Higher energy leads to more particle emissions.      Cross-section for reactions \\((a,xn)\\) shows Gaussian-like behavior:                  Increases to a maximum.          Decreases as higher energy promotes additional particle emissions.                                Figure-3: At higher incident energies, it is more likely that additional neu-trons will “evaporate” from the compound nucleus.                    ","categories": ["lecture"],

        "title": "Scattering Revisited",
        "excerpt":"  In this lecture, we will start by revisiting the basics of quantum scattering, focusing on partial wave analysis and phase shifts. The graph at the top illustrates the Breit-Wigner resonance curve, which we will discuss in detail after exploring resonance scattering and its role in energy-dependent cross-sections. Scattering Cross-Section The one-dimensional Schrödinger equation for a particle of mass $m$ in a potential $V(x)$ is: \\[-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} + V(x)\\psi = E\\psi.\\]The general solution is: \\[\\psi(x) = \\begin{cases} Ae^{ikx} + Be^{-ikx}, &amp; E &gt; V \\ (\\text{plane waves}), \\\\C e^{-\\lambda x}, &amp; E &lt; V \\ (\\text{exponential decay}),\\end{cases}\\]where $k = \\sqrt{2m(E - V) / \\hbar^2}$ and $\\lambda = \\sqrt{2m(V - E) / \\hbar^2}$. Bound States Bound states occur for $E &lt; V$, where wavefunctions decay exponentially: \\[\\psi(x) \\sim e^{-\\lambda |x|}, \\quad E = V - \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\lambda^2}{2m}.\\]Such states have discrete energy levels, a hallmark of quantum systems. Scattering States Scattering states arise when $E &gt; V$, allowing free motion: \\[\\psi(x) \\sim e^{\\pm ikx}.\\]The energy relation is $E = V + \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}$. Scattering Cross-Section  For the scattering potential $V(\\mathbf{x})$, the total wavefunction at point $p$ is sum of plane wave and spherical wave modulated by factor $f$ due to scattering and is given by: \\[\\psi(\\mathbf{x}) = e^{i\\mathbf{k \\cdot x}} + f(\\mathbf{k',k}) \\frac{e^{ikr}}{r}, \\text{and}\\;r=|\\mathbf{x}|\\]where $f(\\mathbf{k’,k})$ is the scattering amplitude: \\[f(\\mathbf{k',k}) = -\\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\int d^3x' e^{-i\\mathbf{k' \\cdot x'}} V(\\mathbf{x'}) \\psi(\\mathbf{x'}).\\]The differential cross-section is: \\[\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = |f(\\mathbf{k',k})|^2.\\]The total cross-section integrates over all angles: \\[\\sigma_{\\text{total}} = \\int \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} \\, d\\Omega.\\]Partial Wave Analysis Expanding the incident wave in spherical harmonics $Y_{lm}(\\theta, \\phi)$: \\[\\phi(\\mathbf{x}) = e^{i\\mathbf{k \\cdot x}} = \\sum_{l=0}^\\infty (2l+1) i^l j_l(kr) P_l(\\cos\\theta).\\]The differential cross-section becomes: \\[\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\left| \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{l=0}^\\infty (2l+1) e^{i\\delta_l} \\sin\\delta_l P_l(\\cos\\theta) \\right|^2.\\]Here, $\\delta_l$ are phase shifts from scattering. Nuclear Reactions: Revisited Here, we introduce Direct and Compound nuclear reactions to contrast them with Resonance Reactions, which serve as an intermediate between the two. 1. Direct Reactions Direct reactions occur when the incident particle interacts with the nucleus over a short time, leading to a direct transition between nuclear states. These reactions are characterized by their fast nature and relatively low probability of occurrence. Key Features   Short interaction time: The process occurs quickly, typically within $10^{-22}$ seconds.  Small energy transfer: The incident particle imparts minimal energy to the nucleus.  Types of direct reactions: Elastic scattering, inelastic scattering, transfer reactions, and knockout reactions.2. Compound Nucleus Reactions Compound nucleus reactions occur when the incident particle is fully absorbed by the target nucleus, forming an intermediate, highly excited state. This intermediate state, known as the compound nucleus, subsequently decays into a final configuration. Key Features   Formation: The compound nucleus is a short-lived, highly excited state, existing for a relatively long timescale ($10^{-16}$ to $10^{-14}$ seconds) compared to direct reactions.  Statistical nature: The decay channels exhibit a statistical distribution as the compound nucleus loses all memory of the entrance channel’s specific properties.          Decay mechanism: The decay of the compound nucleus mimics evaporation, where the emitted particle behaves like a droplet evaporating from a heated liquid. The energy distribution of the emitted particles reflects the thermal excitation of the compound nucleus.      Angular distribution: The angular distribution of emitted particles is typically flat, reflecting the random nature of the decay process and the lack of memory of the entrance channel’s directionality.      Two-step process: The formation and decay of the compound nucleus are independent processes. The compound nucleus achieves equilibrium before decaying, and the final state is uncorrelated with the entrance channel parameters.      3. Resonance Reactions Resonance reactions lie between the extremes of direct reactions and compound nucleus reactions. They involve discrete, quasibound nuclear states in the energy spectrum.   Resonance states: Quasibound states with lifetimes long enough to form distinct energy levels, but still unstable against decay.  High cross-section: Resonances exhibit a significantly increased probability of interaction at specific energies.Formation of Resonances The nuclear potential seen by the incident particle can be approximated by a square-well potential. The wavefunctions inside and outside the well must match smoothly. This matching varies with the incident particle’s energy, leading to the formation of resonances at specific energies. The energy at which the cross-section reaches a maximum is called Resonance energy ($E_r$). The measure of width of peak shown at the top figure is the Resonance width ($\\Gamma$), which is a measure of the energy uncertainty of a quasibound state, which is inversely proportional to its lifetime ($\\tau$), as given by $\\tau = \\hbar / \\Gamma$. Phase Shift Analysis The phase shift $\\delta$ of the scattering wavefunction is crucial for understanding resonances:   A resonance occurs when the phase shift $\\delta$ passes through $\\pi / 2$.  Near a resonance, the phase shift can be expanded as:\\(\\cot \\delta_l = \\frac{E - E_r}{\\Gamma / 2}\\)where $l$ denotes the partial wave contributing to the resonance.    Detailed Calculations:   The cross section for pure elastic scattering for the $l$th partial wave is \\[\\sigma_\\text{el}^l=\\int_{\\Omega}\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega}d\\Omega = \\frac{4\\pi}{k^2} (2l + 1) \\sin^2 \\delta_l = \\frac{4\\pi}{k^2} (2l + 1) \\frac{1}{1 + \\cot^2 \\delta_l}.\\]This has a maximum when $\\delta_l = \\pi/2$. For a spinless (there is no intrinsic spin angular momentum) beam and target, the phase can only depend on the invariant mass of the system, i.e., $\\delta_l = \\delta_l(E)$, where $E = \\sqrt{s}$ and $s = (p_1 + p_2)^2$ is the square of the total four-momentum of the system, so the maximum will occur at some energy $E_r$, and we can make an expansion \\[\\sigma_\\text{el}^l = \\frac{4\\pi}{k^2} (2l + 1) \\frac{1}{1 + \\left[ \\cot \\delta_l(E_r) + (E - E_r) \\left( \\frac{d \\cot \\delta_l(E)}{dE} \\right)_{E = E_r} + \\dots \\right]^2}.\\]In lowest order, noting that $\\cot \\delta_l(E_r)=0$ we have \\[\\sigma_\\text{el}^l = \\frac{4\\pi}{k^2} (2l + 1) \\frac{1}{1 + \\left[\\frac{ 2(E - E_r) }{\\Gamma}\\right]^2},\\]where \\[\\frac{2}{\\Gamma} \\equiv -\\left( \\frac{d \\cot \\delta_l(E)}{dE} \\right)_{E = E_r}.\\]This is the Breit-Wigner resonance formula for a particle with lifetime $\\tau = 1/\\Gamma$: \\[\\sigma_\\text{el}^l = \\frac{4\\pi}{k^2} (2l + 1) \\frac{\\Gamma^2 / 4}{(E - E_r)^2 + \\Gamma^2 / 4}.\\]The Breit-Wigner formula is a fundamental expression in nuclear and particle physics, describing the resonant scattering cross-section as a function of energy. It is particularly useful in characterizing systems where a temporary intermediate state, or resonance, dominates the interaction. The formula peaks at the resonance energy $ E_r $, where the cross-section is maximized, and its shape is governed by the resonance width $ \\Gamma $, also known as the full width at half maximum (FWHM). This width is inversely proportional to the lifetime of the resonance, providing insights into its stability. The prefactor $ (2l + 1) $ accounts for the contribution of angular momentum $ l $, reflecting the degeneracy of the resonant state. The denominator, $ (E - E_r)^2 + \\Gamma^2 / 4 $, determines the characteristic Lorentzian shape of the curve, indicating how the cross-section decreases as energy deviates from $ E_r $. The wave number $ k $ in the prefactor links the cross-section to the momentum of the incoming particle. Widely applicable in areas such as nuclear reactions, particle decay, and quantum scattering, the Breit-Wigner formula provides a quantitative framework to analyze resonant phenomena and extract physical parameters like resonance energy, width, and angular momentum.

        "excerpt":"In this article we will study: •\tOverview of quantum tunneling and its significance.•\tApplications in nuclear potentials and resonant-tunneling diodes.•\tExploration of scattering problems with Rosen-Morse potential.  The potential in the three regions are defined by \\[\\begin{equation} U(x) = \\begin{cases} 0, &amp; \\mbox{when } x &lt; 0 \\\\[4pt] U_0, &amp; \\mbox{when } 0 \\leq x \\leq L \\\\[4pt] 0, &amp; \\mbox{when } x &gt; L \\end{cases} \\label{PIBPotential}\\end{equation}\\]The potential $U(x)$ in ($\\ref{PIBPotential}$) satisfy the Schrödinger equation \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{PIBSchrodinger} -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} + U(x)\\psi = E\\psi\\end{equation}\\]Since the particle energy is $E$ and is less than $U_0$ in region-II therefore the solution of ($\\ref{PIBSchrodinger}$) is exponentially decaying. The solution of ($\\ref{PIBSchrodinger}$) in region-I and region-III are given by plane waves as particle energy is greater than the potential energy in these regions. We expect the solution to be of the form given in figure below:   We write the general solution of ($\\ref{PIBSchrodinger}$) in region-I, region-II and region-III as \\[\\begin{equation}\\psi(x) =\\begin{cases}Ae^{ikx} + Be^{-ikx}, &amp; \\mbox{when } x &lt; 0 \\\\Ce^{\\lambda x} + De^{-\\lambda x}, &amp; \\mbox{when } 0 \\leq x \\leq L \\\\Fe^{ikx} + Ge^{-ikx}, &amp; \\mbox{when } x &gt; L\\end{cases} \\label{PIBGeneralSolution}\\end{equation}\\]where $k = \\sqrt{\\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2}}$ and $\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{2m(U_0-E)}{\\hbar^2}}$ . The coefficient $G$ in region III is zero as there is no incident wave from right side. The continuity of wave function and its derivative at $x = 0$ and $x = L$ gives the following equations \\[\\begin{equation}\\begin{aligned}A + B &amp; = C + D, \\\\ik(A - B) &amp; = \\lambda(C - D), \\quad \\text{Derivative}\\\\Ce^{\\lambda L} + De^{-\\lambda L} &amp; = Fe^{ikL}, \\\\\\lambda(Ce^{\\lambda L} - De^{-\\lambda L}) &amp; = ik Fe^{ikL} \\quad \\text{Derivative}\\end{aligned} \\label{PIBContinuity}\\end{equation}\\]We have four equations ($\\ref{PIBContinuity}$) and five unknowns $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ and $F$. But the quantity of our interest is the transmission coefficient $ T $ and therefore $\\frac{F}{A}$ is the quantity of interest. We therefore divide each equation by $A$ and get the ratio coefficients in terms of $A$ as \\(\\begin{equation}\\begin{aligned}1 + \\frac{B}{A} &amp; = \\frac{C}{A} + \\frac{D}{A}, \\\\ik(1 - \\frac{B}{A}) &amp; = \\lambda(\\frac{C}{A} - \\frac{D}{A}), \\\\\\frac{C}{A}e^{\\lambda L} + \\frac{D}{A}e^{-\\lambda L} &amp; = \\frac{F}{A}e^{ikL}, \\\\\\lambda(\\frac{C}{A}e^{\\lambda L} - \\frac{D}{A}e^{-\\lambda L}) &amp; = ik \\frac{F}{A}e^{ikL}\\end{aligned} \\label{PIBContinuityRatio}\\end{equation}\\)Solving for $\\frac{F}{A}$ we get\\(\\begin{equation}\\frac{F}{A} = \\frac{  e^{-i k L}}{\\cosh (\\lambda  L)+\\frac{i}{2}(\\frac{\\lambda}{k}-\\frac{k}{\\lambda}) \\sinh (\\lambda  L)} \\label{PIBTransmission}\\end{equation}\\)The transmission coefficient $T$ is given by\\(\\begin{equation}T=|\\frac{F}{A}|^2 = \\frac{ 1}{\\cosh^2 (\\lambda  L)+\\frac{1}{4}(\\frac{\\lambda}{k}-\\frac{k}{\\lambda})^2 \\sinh^2 (\\lambda  L)} \\label{PIBTransmissionCoefficient}\\end{equation}\\)Similarly the reflection coefficient $R$ is given by\\(\\begin{equation}R = |\\frac{B}{A}|^2 =\\frac{1}{\\frac{4 k^2 \\lambda ^2 \\text{csch}^2(\\lambda  L)}{\\left(k^2+\\lambda ^2\\right)^2}+1} \\label{PIBReflectionCoefficient}\\end{equation}\\)One can check that $T + R = 1$ as expected. The Transmission coefficient can be represented as a function of $U$ and $E$ as\\(\\begin{equation}T = \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{U^2}{8 (E^2-U^2)}\\left(1- \\cosh \\left(2  L \\sqrt{\\frac{2m (U-E)}{\\hbar ^2}}\\right)\\right)}\\label{PIBT}\\end{equation}\\)The Transmission and Reflection coefficient is plotted as a function of $U$ in the figure below keeping $\\hbar^2=2m=1,\\;L=1$ and $E=0.1$:   Similarly the Transmission and Reflection coefficient is plotted as a function of $L$ in the figure below keeping $\\hbar^2=2m=1,\\;U=2$ and $E=1$:   The Transmission and Reflection coefficient is plotted as a function of $E$ in the figure below keeping $\\hbar^2=2m=1,\\;U=2$ and $L=1$:   Observations:       The Transmission coefficient increases with an increase in $E$, while it decreases with an increase in $U$ and $L$. This behavior is consistent with the tunneling phenomena, where higher energy ($E$) increases the likelihood of transmission, and higher potential barrier ($U$) or width ($L$) suppresses it.         The wave function is exponentially decaying in region-II (inside the barrier) and takes the form of a plane wave in region-I (before the barrier) and region-III (after the barrier).         In region-I and region-III, the wave function is oscillatory and normalizable over finite spatial intervals. However, for extended or infinite domains, non-normalizable wavefunctions are encountered due to the scattering nature of the problem. Potentials of this type can give rise to quasi-bound states, characterized by resonances rather than bound energy levels.         In Quasi-Bound states, the probability density is not defined globally due to non-normalizability. Instead, the probability current is used to describe the behavior of the system. The probability current is conserved across all three regions, ensuring the continuity of physical observables.         The conservation of probability current leads to the derivation of reflection and transmission coefficients, providing quantitative measures of how the wave interacts with the potential barrier.   Few Quasi-Bound Potentials that exhibit Tunneling Nuclear Potential Model: Attractive and Repulsive Interactions The nuclear potential is modeled to represent the interactions between nucleons (protons and neutrons) within an atomic nucleus. The attractive nuclear force between nucleons is depicted by a negative potential well, which holds the nucleons together. This attractive force is short-range, meaning it becomes effective only within the confines of the nucleus. Outside the nucleus, the electrostatic repulsion between protons (due to their positive charge) dominates, represented by a $\\frac{1}{r}$ potential, which increases as the distance between particles increases. This electrostatic repulsion counteracts the attractive nuclear force at larger distances, ensuring that the nucleons are confined to the nucleus but still experience repulsion as they move further apart.   Tunneling phenomena: An alpha particle can be emitted or absorbed through quantum tunneling. When the nucleus has enough energy to overcome the potential barrier created by the electrostatic repulsion, the alpha particle (comprising two protons and two neutrons) can escape the nucleus. This process, known as alpha decay, is facilitated by tunneling through the potential barrier, despite the particle’s energy being lower than the barrier height. Conversely, an alpha particle can also be absorbed by the nucleus if the incoming particle’s energy and the potential conditions align, leading to an increase in the nucleus’s energy state. Resonant-Tunneling Diode and Quantum Dot Mechanism:     Resonant-Tunneling Diode: (a) A gallium arsenide quantum dot embedded in aluminum arsenide. (b) A potential well with two barriers and no voltage bias, where electron energies in aluminum arsenide do not align with the quantum dot's energy levels, preventing tunneling. (c) The potential well with an applied voltage bias, aligning the electron energies in the dot and aluminum arsenide, enabling tunneling through the dot. In resonant tunneling devices, quantum dots act as potential wells with quantized energy levels for electrons. These dots are embedded in semiconductor materials, where potential barriers exist at the dot boundaries. Electrons outside the dot cannot tunnel through unless their energy matches the quantized energy level inside the dot. This alignment occurs when an external voltage bias lowers one of the barriers, allowing tunneling to occur. As the bias is increased further, alignment is lost and tunneling stops. When the bias is adjusted to match the next energy level, tunneling resumes. This energy-dependent tunneling is the key mechanism in resonant-tunneling diodes, enabling high-speed switching in nano-electronic devices. Scattering Problems: In quantum mechanics, the scattering nature of a problem involves the interaction of a particle (or wave) with a potential barrier, resulting in partial reflection and transmission. Unlike bound state problems, where particles are confined, scattering problems describe particles free to move before and after encountering the potential. These problems feature wave functions that extend to infinity and are not square-integrable, requiring flux conservation for analysis. Key characteristics of scattering problems include:   Unbounded domains: The wave functions extend infinitely in space and cannot be normalized to unity, unlike bound states.  Superposition of waves: The wave function is a combination of an incident wave (approaching the potential), a reflected wave (bouncing back), and a transmitted wave (continuing beyond the potential).  Continuity across boundaries: The wave function and its derivative remain smooth and continuous at the boundaries of the potential, ensuring accurate computation of reflection and transmission probabilities.  Oscillatory, non-normalizable solutions: The wave functions oscillate and cannot be normalized, so flux conservation through probability current is used to describe the system’s behavior.Rosen-Morse Potential The Rosen-Morse potential is a model potential in quantum mechanics given by: \\[V(x) = -V_0 \\, \\text{sech}^2(x) + \\lambda \\, \\tanh(x),\\]where $ V_0 $ represents the depth of the potential, and $ \\lambda $ introduces an asymmetry in the potential. This potential is widely used because it is exactly solvable and provides insights into both bound states and scattering states. Bound States   For specific energy levels less than the asymptotic value of the potential, $ E &lt; 0 $, the particle remains localized within the potential well.  The wave functions for bound states are normalizable and decay exponentially outside the well, indicating confinement.  The discrete energy spectrum of bound states depends on the parameters $ V_0 $ and $ \\lambda $, reflecting the depth and asymmetry of the well.As an example consider the symmetric Rosen-Morse potential with $ V_0 = 12 $ and $ \\lambda = 0 $. The potential has the following shape as shown in figure below:   The energy and bound state wave functions are\\(\\begin{equation}\\begin{aligned}E_0 &amp; = -9, &amp; \\psi_0(x) &amp; = \\sqrt{\\frac{15}{16}} \\, \\text{sech}^3(x), \\\\E_1 &amp; = -4, &amp; \\psi_1(x) &amp; = \\sqrt{\\frac{15}{4}} \\, \\text{sech}^2(x) \\, \\text{tanh}(x), \\\\E_2 &amp; = -1, &amp; \\psi_2(x) &amp; = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{16}} \\, \\text{sech}(x) \\, \\left( 5 \\, \\text{tanh}^2(x) - 1 \\right).\\end{aligned} \\label{RosenMorseBound}\\end{equation}\\)There are only three bound states for the symmetric Rosen-Morse potential. The wave functions are normalized to unity and exhibit exponential decay outside the potential well as shown in figure below. For energy levels beyond the potential asymptote, the particle transitions to scattering states.   Scattering States   When the particle’s energy exceeds the potential asymptote, $ E &gt; 0 $, it transitions to a scattering regime.  In scattering states, the wave function describes a free particle that interacts with the potential but is not confined.  The wave function exhibits oscillatory behavior, representing incident, reflected, and transmitted waves.  The reflection and transmission coefficients depend on $ V_0 $, $ \\lambda $, and the particle’s energy, showing how the potential influences scattering behavior.Physical Significance The Rosen-Morse potential is significant because it demonstrates the coexistence of bound and scattering states in a single potential framework. Bound states represent localized solutions, while scattering states describe delocalized solutions, highlighting the dual nature of quantum systems depending on the energy of the particle relative to the potential landscape.

        "title": "The Concept of Isospin",
        "excerpt":"Isospin is a quantum number that describes the symmetry between particles with similar properties but different electric charges. It was first proposed by Werner Heisenberg in 1932 to explain the near-degeneracy of protons and neutrons. These particles, collectively called nucleons, were found to behave similarly under the strong nuclear force, suggesting an underlying symmetry. Isospin is represented by two quantum numbers:   Total Isospin ($ I $): This can take integer or half-integer values (e.g., $ 0, \\frac{1}{2}, 1, \\frac{3}{2} $).  Third Component of Isospin ($ I_3 $): This represents the projection of isospin along a chosen axis and can take values from $ -I $ to $ +I $ in integer steps.For example:   Protons and neutrons form an isospin doublet with $ I = \\frac{1}{2} $. The proton has $ I_3 = +\\frac{1}{2} $, and the neutron has $ I_3 = -\\frac{1}{2} $.  Pions ($ \\pi^+, \\pi^0, \\pi^- $) form an isospin triplet with $ I = 1 $ and $ I_3 = +1, 0, -1 $, respectively.Isospin Symmetry Isospin symmetry arises from the charge independence of the strong interaction. This means that the strong force between two protons ($ pp $), two neutrons ($ nn $), or a proton and a neutron ($ np $) is nearly identical. However, this symmetry is approximate and is broken by:   The electromagnetic interaction, which differentiates between charged and neutral particles.

This doublet structure arises because the up and down quarks have nearly identical masses and interact similarly under the strong force, despite their different electric charges. The isospin properties of these quarks are as follows:   Up Quark ($ u $):          Isospin $ I = \\frac{1}{2} $.      Third component $ I_3 = +\\frac{1}{2} $.      Electric charge $ Q = +\\frac{2}{3} $.        Down Quark ($ d $):          Isospin $ I = \\frac{1}{2} $.      Third component $ I_3 = -\\frac{1}{2} $.      Electric charge $ Q = -\\frac{1}{3} $.      The remaining quarks—strange ($ s $), charm ($ c $), bottom ($ b $), and top ($ t $) do not participate in isospin symmetry and has $ I = 0 $. Hadrons Hadrons are particles made of quarks and are classified into two main categories: mesons (quark-antiquark pairs) and baryons (three-quark states). The isospin properties of hadrons depend on the isospin of their constituent quarks. Mesons Mesons are quark-antiquark pairs and can form isospin singlets, doublets, or triplets depending on the quark content. Examples include:   Pions ($ \\pi^+, \\pi^0, \\pi^- $):          These form an isospin triplet ($ I = 1 $) with $ I_3 = +1, 0, -1 $, respectively.      Quark content:                  $ \\pi^+ = u\\bar{d} $.          $ \\pi^0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(u\\bar{u} - d\\bar{d}) $.          $ \\pi^- = d\\bar{u} $.                      Eta Meson ($ \\eta^0 $):          This is an isospin singlet ($ I = 0 $).      Quark content: $ \\eta^0 $ is a mixture of $ u\\bar{u} $, $ d\\bar{d} $, and $ s\\bar{s} $.      Baryons Baryons are three-quark states and can form isospin singlets, doublets, or triplets. Examples include:   Nucleons ($ p, n $):          These form an isospin doublet ($ I = \\frac{1}{2} $) with $ I_3 = +\\frac{1}{2} $ for the proton and $ I_3 = -\\frac{1}{2} $ for the neutron.      Quark content:                  Proton ($ p $) = $ uud $.          Neutron ($ n $) = $ udd $.                      Delta Baryons ($ \\Delta^{++}, \\Delta^+, \\Delta^0, \\Delta^- $):          These form an isospin quartet ($ I = \\frac{3}{2} $) with $ I_3 = +\\frac{3}{2}, +\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{3}{2} $, respectively.      Quark content:                  $ \\Delta^{++} = uuu $.          $ \\Delta^+ = uud $.          $ \\Delta^0 = udd $.          $ \\Delta^- = ddd $.                    Strange Hadrons Hadrons containing strange quarks ($ s $) also exhibit isospin properties, but the strange quark itself does not contribute to isospin. Examples include:   Kaons ($ K^+, K^0 $):          These form an isospin doublet ($ I = \\frac{1}{2} $) with $ I_3 = +\\frac{1}{2} $ for $ K^+ $ and $ I_3 = -\\frac{1}{2} $ for $ K^0 $.      Quark content:                  $ K^+ = u\\bar{s} $.          $ K^0 = d\\bar{s} $.                      Lambda Baryon ($ \\Lambda^0 $):          This is an isospin singlet ($ I = 0 $).      Quark content: $ \\Lambda^0 = uds $.      Conservation of Isospin       Strong InteractionsIsospin is conserved in strong interactions. This means that the total isospin $ I $ and its third component $ I_3 $ remain unchanged during processes like particle collisions or decays mediated by the strong force.         Electromagnetic and Weak InteractionsIsospin conservation breaks down in electromagnetic and weak interactions:           Electromagnetic interactions violate total isospin $ I $ but conserve $ I_3 $.      Weak interactions violate both $ I $ and $ I_3 $. For example, in beta decay ($ n \\rightarrow p + e^- + \\bar{\\nu}_e $), the isospin changes by $ \\Delta I = \\frac{1}{2} $.      Examples of Isospin Example 1: Pion-Nucleon Scattering ($ \\pi^+ + p \\rightarrow \\pi^+ + p $) Problem: Analyze the isospin conservation in the scattering process $ \\pi^+ + p \\rightarrow \\pi^+ + p $. Solution:   Initial State:          $ \\pi^+ $: $ I = 1 $, $ I_3 = +1 $.      $ p $: $ I = \\frac{1}{2} $, $ I_3 = +\\frac{1}{2} $.      Total initial isospin: $ I_{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{3}{2} $ or $ \\frac{1}{2} $.        Final State:          $ \\pi^+ $: $ I = 1 $, $ I_3 = +1 $.      $ p $: $ I = \\frac{1}{2} $, $ I_3 = +\\frac{1}{2} $.      Total final isospin: $ I_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{3}{2} $ or $ \\frac{1}{2} $.        Conclusion:          Isospin is conserved ($ I_{\\text{initial}} = I_{\\text{final}} $), and the process is allowed in strong interactions.      Example 2: Forbidden Decay ($ \\Sigma^+ \\rightarrow p + \\eta^0 $) Problem: Explain why the decay $ \\Sigma^+ \\rightarrow p + \\eta^0 $ is forbidden. Solution:   Initial State:          $ \\Sigma^+ $: $ I = 1 $, $ I_3 = +1 $.        Final State:          $ p $: $ I = \\frac{1}{2} $, $ I_3 = +\\frac{1}{2} $.      $ \\eta^0 $: $ I = 0 $, $ I_3 = 0 $.      Total final isospin: $ I_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{1}{2} $.        Conclusion:          Isospin is not conserved ($ I_{\\text{initial}} = 1 \\neq I_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{1}{2} $), so the decay is forbidden in strong interactions.      Example 3: Beta Decay ($ n \\rightarrow p + e^- + \\bar{\\nu}_e $) Problem: Analyze the isospin change in the beta decay process $ n \\rightarrow p + e^- + \\bar{\\nu}_e $. Solution:   Initial State:          $ n $: $ I = \\frac{1}{2} $, $ I_3 = -\\frac{1}{2} $.        Final State:          $ p $: $ I = \\frac{1}{2} $, $ I_3 = +\\frac{1}{2} $.      $ e^- $ and $ \\bar{\\nu}_e $: These are leptons and do not contribute to isospin.        Conclusion:          The isospin changes by $ \\Delta I_3 = +1 $, which is allowed in weak interactions.      Applications of Isospin   Classification of HadronsIsospin helps classify hadrons into multiplets based on their symmetry properties. For example:          Nucleons ($ p, n $) form an isospin doublet.      Pions ($ \\pi^+, \\pi^0, \\pi^- $) form an isospin triplet.            Strong Interaction DynamicsIsospin conservation is used to predict the outcomes of strong interaction processes, such as particle scattering and decays.     Connection to Other Quantum NumbersThe Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula connects isospin to other quantum numbers:\\(Q = I_3 + \\frac{B + S}{2},\\)where $ Q $ is the electric charge, $ B $ is the baryon number, and $ S $ is the strangeness.","categories": ["lecture"],
