        "excerpt":"Below is the outline of the lecture on Relativistic Quantum Mechanics, covering the Klein–Gordon equation, Dirac equation, probabilities and current densities, magnetic moment and spin of the electron, and free particle solutions of the Dirac equation. Outline Relativistic QM: Klein – Gordon equation and its merit and demerit, Dirac equation,probabilities and current densities, Magnetic moment and spin of electron, free particlesolution of Dirac equation and interpretation of negative energy states. 15 Lectures  The Klein–Gordon Equation The Klein–Gordon equation is a relativistic wave equation for spin-zero particles. It is given by: \\[\\left( \\Box + \\frac{m^2 c^2}{\\hbar^2} \\right) \\psi = 0\\]where:       \\(\\Box\\) (the d’Alembertian operator) is defined as:\\(\\Box = \\nabla^2 - \\frac{1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2}\\)         \\(\\nabla^2\\) is the Laplace operator, which in three spatial dimensions is: \\[\\nabla^2 = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2}\\]    \\(m\\) is the mass of the particle.  \\(c\\) is the speed of light.      \\(\\hbar\\) (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant:     \\(\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi}\\)where \\(h\\) is the Planck constant.     \\(\\psi\\) is the wave function of the particle.Derivation and Background The Klein–Gordon equation arises from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: \\[E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^2\\]By substituting the quantum mechanical operators for energy \\(E\\) and momentum \\(p\\): \\[E \\rightarrow i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}, \\quad \\mathbf{p} \\rightarrow -i\\hbar \\nabla\\]into the energy-momentum relation, we get: \\[\\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\right)^2 = \\left( -i\\hbar \\nabla \\right)^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4\\]Simplifying this yields: \\[-\\hbar^2 \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} = -\\hbar^2 c^2 \\nabla^2 + m^2 c^4\\]Dividing through by \\(-\\hbar^2\\): \\[\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} - c^2 \\nabla^2 + \\frac{m^2 c^4}{\\hbar^2} = 0\\]Rewriting in a more compact form using the d’Alembertian operator: \\[\\left( \\Box + \\frac{m^2 c^2}{\\hbar^2} \\right) \\psi = 0\\]Applications and Significance   Quantum Field Theory: The Klein–Gordon equation is fundamental in quantum field theory for describing scalar fields and spin-zero particles such as pi-mesons (pions).  Prediction of Antiparticles: The equation predicts the existence of antiparticles, as solutions can have both positive and negative energy.  Historical Context: Independently discovered by Oskar Klein and Walter Gordon in 1926, the Klein–Gordon equation was one of the earliest attempts to formulate a relativistic wave equation.Limitations   Negative Probability Density:          The probability density derived from the Klein-Gordon equation is not always positive-definite, complicating its interpretation as a physical probability distribution.        Inclusion of Negative Energy States:          The equation admits solutions with negative energy, which challenges the straightforward interpretation of these solutions within a single-particle framework.        Inadequate for Particles with Spin:          The Klein-Gordon equation does not account for spin, making it unsuitable for describing fermions, such as electrons, which have non-zero spin.        Unbounded Hamiltonian:          The Hamiltonian associated with the Klein-Gordon equation is not bounded from below, leading to stability issues and necessitating reinterpretation within the framework of quantum field theory.      Dirac Equation The Dirac equation was formulated to address the limitations of the Klein-Gordon equation, specifically to describe spin-1/2 particles and to ensure positive-definite probability densities. Linearizing the Klein-Gordon Equation The Klein-Gordon equation is given by:\\(\\left( \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right) \\psi = 0\\) To derive the Dirac equation, we seek a first-order differential equation in both space and time that would still be consistent with the principles of special relativity. We start with the assumption that the equation should be linear in the first derivatives: \\[\\color{red}{ i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} = \\left( \\alpha \\cdot \\mathbf{p} + \\beta m \\right) \\psi }\\]Here, \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are matrices, and \\(\\mathbf{p} = -i \\hbar \\nabla\\) is the momentum operator. Requirements for Matrices To ensure consistency with special relativity and the correct energy-momentum relation, we require that: \\[E^2 = \\mathbf{p}^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4\\]Square both sides of our proposed equation and taking \\(c=\\hbar=1\\)(natural units): \\[\\left( i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\right)^2 \\psi = \\left( \\alpha \\cdot \\mathbf{p} + \\beta m \\right)^2 \\psi\\]One common representation of dirac matrices \\(\\alpha,\\;\\beta\\) is the Dirac-Pauli representation: \\[\\beta = \\gamma^0 = \\begin{pmatrix} I &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; -I \\end{pmatrix}\\]\\[\\alpha_i = \\gamma^0 \\gamma^i\\]where \\(\\gamma^i\\) are the Dirac gamma matrices. Highlighted section below can be skipped, its just for verification Expanding the right-hand side, we get:$$ - \\hbar^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial t^2} = \\left( \\alpha_i p_i \\alpha_j p_j + \\alpha_i p_i \\beta m + \\beta m \\alpha_j p_j + \\beta^2 m^2 \\right) \\psi $$Using the commutation relations of the matrices \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta\\)$$ \\alpha_i \\alpha_j + \\alpha_j \\alpha_i = 2 \\delta_{ij} I $$$$ \\alpha_i \\beta + \\beta \\alpha_i = 0 $$$$ \\beta^2 = I $$Substituting these back, we get:$$ \\left(  \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} -  \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right) \\psi = 0 $$This reduces to the Klein-Gordon equation, showing that our linear equation is consistent.The Dirac Equation Combining all these and in natural units (\\(\\hbar = c = 1\\)), we get the Dirac equation in the form: \\[i \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} = \\left( \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\cdot \\mathbf{p} + \\beta m \\right) \\psi\\]Rearranging the equation we get \\[\\left[i \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial t} - \\left( \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\cdot \\mathbf{p} + \\beta m \\right) \\right]\\psi=0\\]Multiplying both sides by \\(\\beta\\) and using the relation \\(\\beta^2=I\\) and \\(\\mathbf{p=-i\\nabla}\\) we get \\[\\left[i \\beta \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial t} + \\beta  i\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\nabla} - \\beta^2 m  \\right]\\psi=0\\]Replacing \\(\\beta^2\\) by \\(I\\) and expanding \\(\\mathbf{\\alpha\\cdot\\nabla}\\) we get \\[\\left[i \\beta \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial t} + i\\beta \\left(\\alpha_x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial_x}+\\alpha_y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial_y}+\\alpha_z \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial_z}\\right) - m  \\right]\\psi=0\\]To express the Dirac equation in a covariant form, we introduce the gamma matrices \\(\\gamma^\\mu\\), where \\(\\mu = 0, 1, 2, 3\\). In this notation, \\(\\gamma^0 = \\beta\\) and \\(\\gamma^j = \\beta \\alpha^j\\) for \\(j = 1, 2, 3\\). \\[\\begin{align*}\\left[i \\gamma^0\\partial_0 + i \\gamma^1\\partial_1+i\\gamma^2\\partial_2+i\\gamma^3\\partial_3 - m  \\right]\\psi&amp;=0\\end{align*}\\]The Dirac equation then can be written in a compact form, which is invariant under Lorentz transformations as: \\[(i \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m) \\psi = 0\\]where:   \\(\\partial_\\mu = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\mu}\\) is the four-gradient, with \\(\\partial_0 = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\) and \\(\\partial_i = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}\\) for spatial coordinates.  \\(\\gamma^\\mu\\) are the gamma matrices, which ensure that the equation transforms correctly under Lorentz transformations.This is the Dirac equation, describing spin-1/2 particles in relativistic quantum mechanics.

        "excerpt":"Basic principles and different LASER’s: principles and working of Ruby Laser, He-Ne Laser, Solid state laser, semiconductor laser CO2 LASER and qualitative description of longitudinal and TE- LASER systems, Excimer LASER, Dye LASER, Roman LASER, Plasma recombination LASER. 09 LecturesIntroduction to LASERs   A laser is defined as an optical device that generates an intense beam of light with high coherence and narrow spectral bandwidth. This is achieved through the process of stimulated emission, where an external energy source excites atoms or molecules to a higher energy state. When these excited atoms or molecules return to a lower energy state, they emit photons in phase, leading to the amplification of light. The term “laser” stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation, highlighting its fundamental mechanism of operation.There are two main mechanisms involved in the operation of a laser:       Population Inversion: This is the process where the number of atoms or molecules in an excited state is greater than the number in the ground state. This condition is essential for stimulated emission to occur and for the laser to function effectively.         Stimulated Emission: This is the process where an incoming photon interacts with an excited atom or molecule, causing it to emit a second photon with the same energy, phase, and direction as the incoming photon. This leads to the amplification of light and the generation of a coherent laser beam.   Stimulated emission is the key process that distinguishes lasers from other light sources, such as incandescent bulbs or fluorescent lamps. It is different from spontaneous emission, where an atom or molecule emits a photon randomly and independently of external stimuli. Light-Atom Interaction Process Three processes in which atoms interact with light are given in figure below:  Population Inversion Process We need to create a non-equilibrium situation where more atoms are in a higher-energy state than in a lower-energy state, known as a population inversion. In this situation, the rate of energy radiation by stimulated emission can exceed the rate of absorption, making the system act as a net source of radiation with photon energy E. We achieve population inversion by starting with atoms that have the appropriate excited states. The energy-level diagram for such an atom includes a ground state and three excited states of energies E1, E2, and E3 as given in figure-a:  A laser using a material with these energy levels is called a four-level laser. For laser action, the states with energies E1 and E3 must have short lifetimes of about 10⁻⁸ seconds, while the state with energy E2 must have a long lifetime of about 10⁻³ seconds. This long-lived metastable state can occur due to restrictions imposed by conservation of angular momentum that hinder photon emission. The metastable state is the one we aim to populate. Metastable State: A state of an atom or molecule with a long lifetime due to restrictions on the allowed transitions to lower-energy states.To produce a population inversion, we pump the material to excite the atoms from the ground state into the states of energies E1, E2, and E3 as given in figure-b. In a gas, this can be done by inserting two electrodes into the gas container. When a high voltage is applied to the electrodes, an electric discharge occurs, causing collisions between ionized atoms and electrons that excite the atoms to various energy states. Within about 10⁻⁸ seconds as shown in figure-c, the atoms excited to states E1 and E3 undergo spontaneous photon emission, leaving these states depopulated. Atoms accumulate in the metastable state with energy E2. Although the number of atoms in the metastable state is less than in the ground state, it is much greater than in the nearly unoccupied state of energy E1, resulting in a population inversion of state E2 relative to state E1. The levels E1 and E3 are essential: atoms undergoing spontaneous emission from the E3 level help populate the E2 level, and the presence of the E1 level enables the population inversion.  Types of LASERs 1. Solid State LASERs Solid-state lasers use a solid material as the gain medium. This medium typically consists of a glass or crystalline host material doped with ions that provide the necessary energy states for lasing. Examples of Solid-State Lasers   Ruby Laser  Nd:YAG Laser  Nd:Glass LaserRuby Laser A ruby laser is a type of solid-state laser that uses a synthetic ruby crystal as its gain medium. The first ruby laser was constructed by Theodore H. Maiman in 1960. Construction   The ruby rod, which is 4 cm long and 5 mm in diameter, serves as the laser medium.  Both ends of the rod are highly polished and parallel, with one end partially reflective and the other end fully reflective.  The rod is surrounded by a xenon flash tube, which provides the pumping energy to excite the chromium ions in the ruby. Working Principle   The xenon flash tube emits a burst of light, which excites the chromium ions in the ruby rod to a higher energy state.  These ions then drop to a lower energy state (meta-stable state), where they remain for a relatively long time.  As more ions accumulate in this meta-stable state, a population inversion is achieved.  When an excited ion returns to its ground state, it emits a photon. This photon stimulates other excited ions to emit additional photons, leading to a cascade of stimulated emission.  The emitted photons are reflected back and forth between the two mirrors, amplifying the light with each pass until a coherent beam of light exits through the partially reflective mirror.Drawbacks   Requires high pumping power.  Low efficiency.  Operates in pulsed mode.Applications   Optical photography.  Measurement of plasma properties.  Removal of skin melanin.  Holography.2. Gas LASERs Gas lasers use a gas mixture as the gain medium to produce laser light. The gas mixture can consist of various combinations of noble gases, halogens, and metal vapors, depending on the desired output wavelength and power. Examples of Gas Lasers   He-Ne Laser  CO2 Laser  Argon Ion LaserI. He-Ne Laser The He-Ne laser is a gas laser that uses a mixture of helium and neon gases. It was the first continuous-wave (CW) laser and was developed by Ali Javan and his colleagues in 1960. Construction   A discharge tube containing a mixture of helium and neon gases in the ratio of 10:1.  Mirrors are placed at both ends of the tube, with one fully reflective and the other partially reflective.  The typical length of the discharge tube is 80 cm with a diameter of 1 cm. Working Principle   An electric discharge excites the helium atoms to higher energy levels.  These excited helium atoms collide with neon atoms, transferring energy and exciting the neon atoms to higher energy states.  A population inversion is achieved between certain energy levels of the neon atoms.  The neon atoms emit photons when they return to a lower energy state, producing laser light.  The emitted photons are reflected between the mirrors, amplifying the light through stimulated emission until a coherent beam exits through the partially reflective mirror.Applications   Holography.  Barcode scanning.  Laser printing.  Optical demonstrations in educational settings.II. CO2 LASER The CO₂ laser is a type of gas laser that uses carbon dioxide (CO₂) as the gain medium. It is one of the most powerful and efficient types of lasers and is commonly used for industrial cutting, welding, and medical procedures. Construction   Discharge Tube: The CO₂ laser consists of a gas discharge tube filled with a mixture of carbon dioxide (CO₂), nitrogen (N₂), and helium (He). The typical ratio is CO₂:N₂:He = 1:1:8.  Mirrors: Two mirrors are placed at the ends of the discharge tube, forming an optical resonator. One mirror is fully reflective, while the other is partially reflective, allowing some light to escape as the laser beam.  Electrodes: Electrodes are placed along the discharge tube to create an electric field that excites the gas molecules.  Cooling System: A cooling system is used to dissipate the heat generated during the laser operation.Working Principle   Excitation: When an electric current passes through the discharge tube, it excites the nitrogen molecules to a higher energy state.  Energy Transfer: The excited nitrogen molecules collide with CO₂ molecules, transferring energy and exciting the CO₂ molecules to a higher energy state.  Population Inversion: A population inversion is achieved between the higher energy state (E3) and the lower energy state (E1) of the CO₂ molecules.  Stimulated Emission: CO₂ molecules in the higher energy state return to the lower energy state by emitting photons. These photons stimulate other excited CO₂ molecules to emit more photons of the same wavelength.  Amplification: The emitted photons are reflected back and forth between the mirrors, amplifying the light through stimulated emission until a coherent beam of light exits through the partially reflective mirror.Key Characteristics   Wavelength: The CO₂ laser emits infrared light at a wavelength of 10.6 micrometers (µm).  Efficiency: It has a high efficiency, typically around 10-20%.  Power: Capable of producing continuous wave (CW) or pulsed laser beams with high power output, ranging from a few watts to several kilowatts.Applications   Industrial Cutting and Welding: The high power and precision of CO₂ lasers make them ideal for cutting and welding materials such as metals, plastics, and wood.  Medical Procedures: CO₂ lasers are used in various medical applications, including surgery, dermatology, and dental procedures.  Engraving and Marking: Used for engraving and marking on materials like glass, leather, and ceramics.  Scientific Research: Employed in various scientific experiments and research applications due to their high power and stable output.3. Semiconductor Laser Semiconductor lasers, also known as diode lasers, use semiconductor materials as the gain medium. These lasers are widely used due to their small size, efficiency, and ability to be directly modulated. Examples of Semiconductor Lasers   InP (Indium Phosphide) Laser  GaAs (Gallium Arsenide) LaserConstruction    Active Region: The laser diode has a p-n junction as the active region where the lasing action occurs.  Pumping Mechanism: Electrical current is injected into the p-n junction, causing electrons and holes to recombine and emit photons.  Optical Cavity: The semiconductor material itself forms an optical cavity with reflective surfaces at the ends to provide feedback for the amplification of light.Working Principle 1. Structure of the P-N Junction A semiconductor laser consists of a p-type and an n-type semiconductor material joined together to form a p-n junction. When these two materials are joined, a depletion region is formed at the junction where no free charge carriers (electrons or holes) are present. 2. Forward Biasing the P-N Junction When a forward voltage is applied across the p-n junction (positive voltage to the p-type material and negative to the n-type), electrons from the n-type material and holes from the p-type material are pushed towards the junction. This reduces the width of the depletion region and allows current to flow through the junction. 3. Carrier Injection and Recombination The applied forward voltage causes electrons to be injected into the conduction band of the p-type material and holes into the valence band of the n-type material. At the junction, electrons and holes recombine. This recombination releases energy in the form of photons (light). The process can be described in three steps:   Carrier Injection: Electrons and holes are injected into the active region from the n-type and p-type materials, respectively.  Recombination: In the active region, electrons recombine with holes. Each recombination event releases a photon with energy equal to the bandgap energy of the semiconductor material.  Stimulated Emission: Some of the emitted photons stimulate other electrons to recombine with holes, producing additional photons. This chain reaction results in a significant amplification of light.4. Optical Feedback and Resonance To sustain lasing action, the semiconductor laser has an optical cavity formed by cleaving the semiconductor crystal to create parallel, reflective end faces. These faces act as mirrors, reflecting photons back and forth through the active region. The cavity length is designed such that it supports standing wave patterns of specific wavelengths.   Photon Reflection: Photons emitted due to recombination are reflected back and forth between the mirrors.  Amplification: As photons travel through the active region, they stimulate further recombination events, resulting in the amplification of light.  Coherent Light Emission: When the amplified light reaches a certain intensity, it escapes through the partially reflective mirror at one end of the cavity as a coherent laser beam.5. Threshold Condition For lasing to occur, the gain (amplification) provided by stimulated emission must overcome the losses due to absorption, scattering, and reflection at the mirrors. This condition is known as the threshold condition. The current at which this occurs is called the threshold current.   Below Threshold: Below the threshold current, spontaneous emission dominates, and the device behaves like an LED.  Above Threshold: Above the threshold current, stimulated emission dominates, and the device produces coherent laser light.Key Characteristics   Direct Modulation: The output can be directly modulated by varying the current, making them suitable for telecommunications.  Efficiency: High electrical-to-optical efficiency.  Size: Compact and lightweight, allowing for integration into a variety of electronic devices.Applications   Fiber optic communications.  Laser printers.  Barcode scanners.  Optical data storage (CDs, DVDs).Introduction to Waveguides Waveguides are structures designed to guide electromagnetic waves from one point to another. They are utilized based on the desired operating frequency, power requirements, and acceptable transmission losses. Common types include coaxial cables, two-wire lines, microstrip lines, rectangular waveguides, and optical fibers as shown in figure below.  Longitudinal-Transverse Decompositions To understand wave propagation in waveguides, we use solutions to Maxwell’s equations that describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields along the guiding direction (z) and their confinement in the transverse directions (x, y). The electric and magnetic fields can be represented as: \\[E(x, y, z, t) = E(x, y) e^{j(\\omega t - \\beta z)}\\]\\[H(x, y, z, t) = H(x, y) e^{j(\\omega t - \\beta z)}\\]where \\(\\beta\\) is the propagation wavenumber and \\(\\lambda_g = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta}\\) is the guide wavelength. Decomposition of Fields The fields can be decomposed into transverse and longitudinal components: \\[E(x, y) = E_T(x, y) + \\hat{z}E_z(x, y)\\]\\[H(x, y) = H_T(x, y) + \\hat{z}H_z(x, y)\\]Where the transverse electric field \\(E_T(x, y)\\) can be further decomposed into its x and y components: \\[E_T(x, y) = \\hat{x}E_x(x, y) + \\hat{y}E_y(x, y)\\]Classification of Modes Based on the longitudinal components \\(E_z\\) and \\(H_z\\), modes are classified as:   TEM (Transverse Electric and Magnetic) Modes: \\(E_z = 0\\), \\(H_z = 0\\)  TE (Transverse Electric) Modes: \\(E_z = 0\\), \\(H_z \\neq 0\\)  TM (Transverse Magnetic) Modes: \\(E_z \\neq 0\\), \\(H_z = 0\\)  Hybrid Modes: \\(E_z \\neq 0\\), \\(H_z \\neq 0\\)Advanced LASER Systems Longitudinal LASER Systems Longitudinal LASER systems operate by aligning the optical resonator (cavity) such that the light travels parallel to the cavity’s axis. In these systems, the gain medium is pumped to produce a population inversion, allowing for stimulated emission. The emitted photons travel back and forth between two mirrors at each end of the cavity, amplifying the light through successive passes. The longitudinal modes are determined by the cavity’s length and the refractive index of the gain medium, resulting in discrete frequency modes. These systems are critical for applications requiring high coherence and spectral purity, such as in spectroscopy and communication. Key parameters include the cavity length, the reflectivity of the mirrors, and the gain medium’s properties. Stability and alignment of the optical components are crucial for the effective operation of longitudinal LASER systems. TE-LASER Systems TE (Transverse Electric) LASER systems operate with the electric field component of the light oscillating perpendicular to the direction of propagation within the waveguide or resonator structure. These systems typically involve semiconductor materials and are used in diode lasers, where the active region is sandwiched between two cladding layers with differing refractive indices. This configuration confines the light within the active region and supports transverse electric modes. TE modes are characterized by having no electric field component in the direction of propagation (z-axis), which means the electric field lies entirely in the transverse plane (x, y). TE LASER systems are essential in applications requiring compact, efficient, and high-speed light sources, such as in optical communication, barcode scanning, and laser printing. Their design focuses on optimizing the waveguide structure, material composition, and junction properties to achieve desired performance.

        "excerpt":"The Dirac equation for a free particle is given by: \\[(i \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m) \\psi = 0\\]where \\(\\psi\\) is the Dirac spinor, \\(\\gamma^\\mu\\) are the gamma matrices, \\(\\partial_\\mu\\) denotes the four-gradient, and \\(m\\) is the mass of the particle. The conjugate of the Dirac spinor \\(\\psi\\) is denoted by \\(\\bar{\\psi} = \\psi^\\dagger \\gamma^0\\). Step-by-Step Derivation       Start with the Dirac Equation: \\[(i \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m) \\psi = 0\\]        Multiply from the left by \\(\\bar{\\psi}\\): \\[\\bar{\\psi} (i \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m) \\psi = 0\\]    This expands to: \\[i \\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi - m \\bar{\\psi} \\psi = 0\\]        Take the Dirac conjugate of the Dirac equation:     The Dirac conjugate of the Dirac equation is: \\[\\psi^{\\dagger} ( -i \\overleftarrow{\\partial_\\mu} \\gamma^{\\mu\\;\\dagger} - m) = 0\\]    Here, \\(\\overleftarrow{\\partial_\\mu}\\) indicates that the derivative acts to the left. Multiplying both sides by \\(\\gamma^0\\) on R.H.S we get \\[\\psi^{\\dagger} ( -i \\overleftarrow{\\partial_t} \\gamma^{0\\;\\dagger} -i \\overleftarrow{\\partial_k} \\gamma^{k\\;\\dagger} - m)\\gamma^0 = 0\\]    and using the property \\(\\gamma^{k \\dagger}=-\\gamma^{k}\\) and \\(\\gamma^0 \\gamma^k=\\gamma^k\\gamma^0\\) and $k\\neq0$ we get \\[\\psi^{\\dagger} ( -i \\overleftarrow{\\partial_t} \\gamma^{0}\\gamma^0 -i \\overleftarrow{\\partial_k} \\gamma^0\\gamma^{k} - m\\gamma^0) = 0\\]    Now using \\(\\psi^{\\dagger}\\overleftarrow{\\partial_t} \\gamma^0=\\partial_t\\bar{\\psi}\\) we get \\[-i \\partial_t\\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^0 -i \\partial_k\\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^k - m\\bar{\\psi}  = 0\\]    In einstein summation form we get \\[-i \\partial_\\mu\\bar{\\psi} \\;\\gamma^\\mu - m\\bar{\\psi}  = 0\\]    Multiplying by \\(\\psi\\) on R.H.S and cancelling negative sign we get \\[i \\partial_\\mu\\bar{\\psi} \\;\\gamma^\\mu\\psi + m\\bar{\\psi}\\psi  = 0\\]        Combine the results:     From steps 2 and 3, we have: \\[i \\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi = m \\bar{\\psi} \\psi\\]    And: \\[i\\partial_\\mu \\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^\\mu \\psi = - m \\bar{\\psi} \\psi\\]        Add the conjugate equation from the original: \\[i \\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi + \\partial_\\mu \\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^\\mu \\psi = 0\\]    This simplifies to: \\[i \\partial_\\mu (\\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^\\mu \\psi) = 0\\]        Define the current density \\(j^\\mu\\):     The current density \\(j^\\mu\\) is defined as: \\[j^\\mu = \\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^\\mu \\psi\\]    Hence, the above equation becomes: \\[\\partial_\\mu j^\\mu = 0\\]  Conclusion The current density conservation equation derived from the Dirac equation is: \\[\\partial_\\mu j^\\mu = 0\\]This equation expresses the conservation of probability current in relativistic quantum mechanics. The four-current \\(j^\\mu = \\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^\\mu \\psi\\) is conserved, indicating that the total probability (or charge) is conserved in the system. Plane Wave Solution of Dirac Equation Sure, let’s start with the plane wave given by \\[\\psi(x^\\mu) = \\begin{pmatrix} u_A \\\\ u_B \\end{pmatrix} e^{-i p_\\mu x^\\mu}\\]where \\(\\begin{pmatrix} u_A \\\\ u_B \\end{pmatrix}\\) is a spinor, and \\(p_\\mu x^\\mu = p^0 x^0 - \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}\\). and use Dirac equation to solve for the spinors \\(u_A\\), \\(u_B\\) and Energy \\(E\\). Here is step by step solution:       Substitute the Plane Wave Solution:     Substitute \\(\\psi(x)\\) into the Dirac equation: \\[(i \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m) \\psi(x) = 0\\]    Applying the derivative \\(\\partial_\\mu\\): \\[\\color{red}{\\partial_\\mu \\psi(x) = -ip_\\mu \\begin{pmatrix} u_A \\\\ u_B \\end{pmatrix} e^{-i p_\\mu x^\\mu}}\\]    Thus, the Dirac equation becomes: \\[\\left[i \\gamma^\\mu (-ip_\\mu) - m\\right] \\begin{pmatrix} u_A \\\\ u_B \\end{pmatrix} e^{-i p_\\mu x^\\mu} = 0\\]    Simplifying, we get: \\[(\\gamma^\\mu p_\\mu - m) \\begin{pmatrix} u_A \\\\ u_B \\end{pmatrix} = 0\\]    which is a Dirac equation in momentum space.         Writing the Dirac Equation in Matrix Form:     The Dirac equation becomes: \\[\\left( \\gamma^0 p^0 - \\gamma^i p^i - m \\right) \\begin{pmatrix} u_A \\\\ u_B \\end{pmatrix} = 0\\]    Expanding the terms, we have: \\[\\color{red}{ \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix}I &amp; 0 \\\\0 &amp; -I\\end{pmatrix} p^0 - \\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; \\sigma^i \\\\-\\sigma^i &amp; 0\\end{pmatrix} p^i - m \\right] \\begin{pmatrix} u_A \\\\ u_B \\end{pmatrix} = 0 }\\]    where the gamma matrices are expanded with the form given by: \\[\\gamma^0 = \\begin{pmatrix}I &amp; 0 \\\\0 &amp; -I\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\gamma^i = \\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; \\sigma^i \\\\-\\sigma^i &amp; 0\\end{pmatrix}\\]    where \\(I\\) is the \\(2 \\times 2\\) identity matrix, and \\(\\sigma^i\\) (with \\(i = 1, 2, 3\\)) are the Pauli matrices: \\[\\sigma^1 = \\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; 1 \\\\1 &amp; 0\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\sigma^2 = \\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; -i \\\\i &amp; 0\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\sigma^3 = \\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 0 \\\\0 &amp; -1\\end{pmatrix}\\]        Substitute the Pauli spin matrices and Simplify:     On simplifying the above matrix we get: \\[\\begin{pmatrix} I(p^0-m) &amp; -\\sigma^i p^i \\\\\\sigma^i p^i &amp; - I(p^0+m)\\end{pmatrix}  \\begin{pmatrix} u_A \\\\ u_B \\end{pmatrix}  = 0\\]    Or, \\[\\begin{pmatrix} I(E-m) &amp; -\\sigma^i p^i \\\\\\sigma^i p^i &amp; - I(E+m)\\end{pmatrix}  \\begin{pmatrix} u_A \\\\ u_B \\end{pmatrix}  = 0\\]    Or, \\[\\begin{pmatrix}E-m &amp; 0 &amp; -p_z &amp; -(p_x-ip_y) \\\\0 &amp; E-m &amp; -(p_x+ip_y) &amp; p_z\\\\p_z &amp; (p_x-ip_y)&amp;-(E+m)&amp;0\\\\(p_x+ip_y) &amp; -p_z &amp;0 &amp;-(E+m)\\end{pmatrix}  \\begin{pmatrix} u_A \\\\ u_B \\end{pmatrix}  = 0\\]  Here, the spinor \\(\\begin{pmatrix} u_A \\\\ u_B \\end{pmatrix}\\) can take four possible form; two for positive energy \\(E=\\sqrt{p^2+m^2}\\) and two for negative energy \\(E=-\\sqrt{p^2+m^2}\\) as:       For Positive energy: \\[u_1=N_1\\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\0 \\\\ A_1\\\\B_1 \\end{pmatrix}\\qquad u_2=N_2\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\1 \\\\ A_2\\\\B_2 \\end{pmatrix}\\]    where, \\((A_1,\\;B_1)\\) and \\((A_2,\\;B_2)\\) are \\((\\frac{p_z}{E+m} , \\frac{p_x+i p_y}{E+m})\\) and \\((\\frac{p_x-i p_y}{E+m} , \\frac{-p_z}{E+m})\\) respectively. \\(N_i\\) are normalization constant.         For Negative energy: \\[u_3=N_3\\begin{pmatrix} A_3\\\\B_3 \\\\ 1\\\\0 \\end{pmatrix}\\qquad u_4=N_4\\begin{pmatrix} A_4\\\\B_4 \\\\ 0\\\\1  \\end{pmatrix}\\]    where, \\((A_3,\\;B_3)\\) and \\((A_4,\\;B_4)\\) are \\((\\frac{p_z}{E-m} , \\frac{p_x+i p_y}{E-m})\\) and \\((\\frac{p_x-i p_y}{E-m} , \\frac{-p_z}{E-m})\\) respectively.   Therefore the eigenfunctions corresponding to positive energy states are: \\[\\psi_1(x^\\mu)=u_1e^{-ip_\\mu x^\\mu}\\qquad \\psi_2(x^\\mu)=u_2e^{-ip_\\mu x^\\mu}\\]and for negative energy state the eigenfunctions are: \\[\\psi_3(x^\\mu)=u_3e^{ip_\\mu x^\\mu}\\qquad \\psi_4(x^\\mu)=u_4e^{ip_\\mu x^\\mu}\\]Interpretation of negative energy states To be continued … ","categories": ["lecture"],

Partial Wave Analysis and Phase Shifts The incident plane wave \\[\\phi(\\mathbf{x})=e^{i\\mathbf{k\\cdot x}}\\]can be expanded in terms of spherical harmonics \\(Y_{lm}(\\theta,\\phi)\\) as \\[\\begin{align}e^{i\\mathbf{k\\cdot x}}&amp;=\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\sum_{m=-l}^l C_{lm}\\; j_l(kr)Y_{lm}(\\theta,\\phi)\\end{align}\\]where, \\(j_l(kr)\\) is the spherical Bessel function of the first kind and \\(C_{lm}\\) is the constant. Since a plane wave is symmetric in \\(\\phi\\) coordinate and therefore it is independent of \\(m\\), further at large distances from the scattering source, the behavior of the spherical Bessel function is approximated as \\[\\begin{align}j_l(kr)&amp;\\approx \\frac{\\sin(kr-l\\pi/2)}{kr}\\\\&amp;=\\frac{1}{2ikr}\\left[e^{i(kr-l\\pi/2)}-e^{-i(kr-l\\pi/2)}\\right]\\end{align}\\]therefore the incident plane wave can be written as \\[\\begin{align}e^{i\\mathbf{k\\cdot x}}&amp;=\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty C_l \\; j_l(kr)P_l(\\cos \\theta)\\\\&amp;=\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty\\;C_l\\; j_l(kr)P_l(\\cos \\theta)\\\\&amp;=\\frac{1}{2ik}\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\;C_l\\left[\\frac{e^{i(kr-l\\pi/2)}}{r}-\\frac{e^{-i(kr-l\\pi/2)}}{r}\\right]P_l(\\cos \\theta)\\end{align}\\]where, \\(P_l(\\cos \\theta)\\) is the Legendre polynomial of degree \\(l\\) and \\(C_l=(2l+1)\\;i^l\\). The scattering wavefunction \\(\\psi(\\mathbf{x})\\) can then rewritten in terms of summation of partial waves as \\[\\begin{align}\\psi(\\mathbf{x})&amp;= \\psi(\\mathbf{x})\\\\&amp;=e^{i\\mathbf{k\\cdot x}}+f(\\mathbf{k',k})\\frac{e^{ikr}}{r}\\\\&amp;=\\frac{1}{2ik}\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\;C_l\\left[\\frac{e^{i(kr-l\\pi/2)}}{r}-\\frac{e^{-i(kr-l\\pi/2)}}{r}\\right]P_l(\\cos \\theta)+ f(\\mathbf{k',k})\\frac{e^{ikr}}{r}\\\\\\end{align}\\]We will use the fact that the amplitude of incoming wave is the same as the amplitude of outgoing wave at large distances from the scattering source. Therefore the above equation can be written as summation over two terms by doing phase shifts of outgoing waves inside the summation to incorporate the outgoing term \\(f(\\mathbf{k',k})\\frac{e^{ikr}}{r}\\) as \\[\\begin{align}\\psi(\\mathbf{x})&amp;=\\frac{1}{2ik}\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\;C_l\\left[\\frac{e^{i(kr-l\\pi/2)+2i\\delta_l}}{r}-\\frac{e^{-i(kr-l\\pi/2)}}{r}\\right]P_l(\\cos \\theta)\\\\&amp;=\\frac{1}{2ik}\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\;C_l\\left[\\frac{e^{ikr}}{r}e^{i(2\\delta_l-l\\pi/2)}-\\frac{e^{-i(kr-l\\pi/2)}}{r}\\right]P_l(\\cos \\theta)\\\\&amp;=\\frac{1}{2ik}\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\;C_l\\left[\\frac{e^{ikr}}{r}(-i)^le^{i2\\delta_l}-\\frac{e^{-i(kr-l\\pi/2)}}{r}\\right]P_l(\\cos \\theta)\\\\\\end{align}\\]where, \\(\\delta_l\\) is the phase shift for the \\(l\\)-th partial wave. The scattering amplitude \\(f(\\mathbf{k',k})=f(\\theta)\\) can therefore be calculated from two successive results by comparing the factor of \\(\\frac{e^{ikr}}{r}\\) as \\[\\begin{align}f(\\theta)&amp;= \\frac{1}{2ik}\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\;C_l\\;(-i)^l\\left[e^{i2\\delta_l}-1\\right]P_l(\\cos \\theta)\\\\&amp;= \\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\;C_l\\;(-i)^l\\;\\frac{e^{i2\\delta_l}-1}{2i}P_l(\\cos \\theta)\\\\&amp;= \\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\;C_l\\;(-i)^l\\;\\sin \\delta_l\\;e^{i\\delta_l}P_l(\\cos \\theta)\\\\&amp;=\\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\;(2l+1)\\;(-i)^{2l}\\;\\sin \\delta_l\\;e^{i\\delta_l}P_l(\\cos \\theta)\\\\&amp;=\\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\;(2l+1)\\;\\sin \\delta_l\\;e^{i\\delta_l}P_l(\\cos \\theta)\\\\\\end{align}\\]Therefore the differential scattering cross-section is given by \\[\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega}=\\left| \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\;(2l+1)\\;\\sin \\delta_l\\;e^{i\\delta_l}P_l(\\cos \\theta)\\right|{}^2\\]","categories": ["lecture"],

        "excerpt":"Perturbation theory is a powerful tool in quantum mechanics used to study systems where the Hamiltonian can be separated into a known part \\(H_0\\) and a small perturbation \\(H'\\). The goal is to find approximate solutions to the Schrödinger equation for the full Hamiltonian \\(H = H_0 + H'\\) by treating the perturbation as a small correction to the known system. Time Independent Perturbation Theory: Non-degenerate Case Suppose we have a Hamiltonian \\[H = H_0 + \\lambda H'\\]where \\(\\lambda\\) is a small parameter. The Hamiltonian \\(H_0\\) is the unperturbed Hamiltonian whose eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are known say \\(E_n^{(0)}\\) and \\(\\psi_n^{(0)}\\) respectively. The Hamiltonian \\(H'\\) is the perturbation to the Hamiltonian \\(H_0\\). Now the problem is to find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian \\(H\\).   If the unperturbed Hamiltonian \\(H_0\\) is known, then the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of \\(H\\) can be found by using perturbation theory.  The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of \\(H\\) can be expanded in powers of \\(\\lambda\\).      The eigenvalues of \\(H\\) are given by: \\[E_n = E_n^{(0)} + \\lambda E_n^{(1)} + \\lambda^2 E_n^{(2)} + \\cdots\\]    where \\(E_n^{(0)}\\) are the eigenvalues of \\(H_0\\) and \\(E_n^{(1)}\\) are the first order corrections to the eigenvalues. Similarly, \\(E_n^{(2)}\\) are the second order corrections to the eigenvalues.         The eigenfunctions of \\(H\\) are given by: \\[\\psi_n = \\psi_n^{(0)} + \\lambda \\psi_n^{(1)} + \\lambda^2 \\psi_n^{(2)} + \\cdots\\]    where \\(\\psi_n^{(0)}\\) are the eigenfunctions of \\(H_0\\) and \\(\\psi_n^{(1)}\\) are the first order corrections to the eigenfunctions. Similarly, \\(\\psi_n^{(2)}\\) are the second order corrections to the eigenfunctions.         The first order correction to the eigenvalues is given by: \\[E_n^{(1)} = \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n^{(0)} \\, d\\tau\\]    One gets this by substituting the above expression for \\(E_n\\) into the Schrödinger equation and then projecting the equation onto \\(\\psi_n^{(0)}\\). We will use the fact that \\[\\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} \\psi_n \\, d\\tau = \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} \\psi_n^{(0)} \\, d\\tau = 1\\]    Expanding the Schrödinger equation gives \\[\\begin{align}  \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} (H_0 + \\lambda H') \\psi_n \\, d\\tau &amp;= E_n \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} \\psi_n \\, d\\tau\\\\  \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H_0 \\psi_n \\, d\\tau + \\lambda \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n \\, d\\tau &amp;= E_n \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} \\psi_n^{(0)} \\, d\\tau\\\\  E_n^{(0)} \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} \\psi_n \\, d\\tau + \\lambda \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n \\, d\\tau &amp;= E_n \\\\  E_n^{(0)} \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} \\psi_n^{(0)} \\, d\\tau + \\lambda \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n \\, d\\tau &amp;= E_n^{(0)}+ \\lambda E_n^{(1)}+ \\lambda^2 E_n^{(2)} + \\cdots\\\\  E_n^{(0)}+ \\lambda \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n \\, d\\tau &amp;= E_n^{(0)}+ \\lambda E_n^{(1)}+ \\lambda^2 E_n^{(2)} + \\cdots\\\\  \\lambda \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n \\, d\\tau &amp;= \\lambda E_n^{(1)}+ \\lambda^2 E_n^{(2)} + \\cdots  \\end{align}\\]    Expanding the perturbative term on L.H.S. of the above equation gives \\[\\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n \\, d\\tau =\\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n^{(0)} \\, d\\tau+ \\lambda\\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n^{(1)} \\, d\\tau+ \\lambda^2\\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n^{(2)} \\, d\\tau+ \\cdots\\]    therefore the Schrödinger equation gives     \\(\\lambda\\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n^{(0)} \\, d\\tau+ \\lambda^2\\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n^{(1)} \\, d\\tau+ \\cdots=\\lambda E_n^{(1)}+ \\lambda^2 E_n^{(2)} + \\cdots\\)     we get first order corrections to the eigenvalues as \\[\\boxed{E_n^{(1)} = \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n^{(0)} \\, d\\tau}\\]    First order correction can be calculated as the expression of the eigenfunction \\(\\psi_n^{(0)}\\) is well known and the matrix element of \\(H'\\) can be calculated. The second order correction to the eigenvalues is given by: \\[\\boxed{E_n^{(2)} = \\int \\psi_n^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n^{(1)} \\, d\\tau}\\]    Here the first order correction to the eigenfunction is needed to calculate the second order correction to the eigenvalues.         The first order correction to the eigenfunctions is given by: \\[\\psi_n^{(1)} = \\sum_{m \\neq n} \\frac{\\int\\psi_m^{(0)*} H' \\psi_n^{(0)}d\\tau}{E_n^{(0)} - E_m^{(0)}}\\psi_m^{(0)}\\]    The first order correction to the eigenfunction can be calculated by using the fact that the eigenfunctions of \\(H_0\\) are known and the matrix elements of \\(H'\\) can be calculated. The first order correction to the eigenfunction is calculated by projecting the Schrödinger equation onto the state \\(\\psi_m^{(0)}\\) where \\(m \\neq n\\).   Time Independent Perturbation Theory: Degenerate Case In the degenerate case, we still have the Hamiltonian \\[H = H_0 + \\lambda H'\\]where \\(\\lambda\\) is a small parameter. The unperturbed Hamiltonian \\(H_0\\) has a set of degenerate eigenstates, meaning there are multiple eigenfunctions corresponding to the same eigenvalue \\(E_n^{(0)}\\). Problem Statement The problem is to find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the perturbed Hamiltonian \\(H\\) when the unperturbed Hamiltonian \\(H_0\\) has degenerate eigenstates. Approach For simplicity, assume that \\(H_0\\) has a degenerate eigenvalue \\(E_n^{(0)}\\) with \\(g\\) degenerate states \\(\\psi_{n,1}^{(0)}, \\psi_{n,2}^{(0)}, \\ldots, \\psi_{n,g}^{(0)}\\). We need to account for the mixing of these degenerate states due to the perturbation \\(H'\\). Eigenvalue and Eigenfunction Expansions The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of \\(H\\) can still be expanded in powers of \\(\\lambda\\): \\[E_n = E_n^{(0)} + \\lambda E_n^{(1)} + \\lambda^2 E_n^{(2)} + \\cdots\\]\\[\\psi_n = \\psi_n^{(0)} + \\lambda \\psi_n^{(1)} + \\lambda^2 \\psi_n^{(2)} + \\cdots\\]However, now \\(\\psi_n^{(0)}\\) is a linear combination of the degenerate states: \\[\\psi_n^{(0)} = \\sum_{k=1}^{g} c_k \\psi_{n,k}^{(0)}\\]First Order Correction to the Eigenvalues To find the first order correction to the eigenvalues, we solve the secular equation by considering the matrix elements of \\(H'\\) in the subspace of the degenerate states: \\[H'_{ij} = \\langle \\psi_{n,i}^{(0)} | H' | \\psi_{n,j}^{(0)} \\rangle\\]We need to solve the eigenvalue problem for the matrix \\(H'\\) restricted to the degenerate subspace: \\[\\sum_{j=1}^{g} H'_{ij} c_j = E_n^{(1)} c_i\\]This is equivalent to finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix \\(H'\\) in the degenerate subspace. The eigenvalues of this matrix are the first order corrections \\(E_n^{(1)}\\). First Order Correction to the Eigenfunctions Once the coefficients \\(c_i\\) are found by solving the secular equation, the first order correction to the eigenfunction \\(\\psi_n^{(0)}\\) can be written as: \\[\\psi_n^{(1)} = \\sum_{m \\neq n} \\frac{\\langle \\psi_m^{(0)} | H' | \\psi_n^{(0)} \\rangle}{E_n^{(0)} - E_m^{(0)}} \\psi_m^{(0)}\\]where \\(\\psi_n^{(0)} = \\sum_{k=1}^{g} c_k \\psi_{n,k}^{(0)}\\). Summary       Solve the secular equation for the degenerate subspace: \\[\\sum_{j=1}^{g} H'_{ij} c_j = E_n^{(1)} c_i\\]        Find the first order correction to the eigenvalues by solving the eigenvalue problem for the matrix \\(H'\\) in the degenerate subspace.         Compute the first order correction to the eigenfunctions using: \\[\\psi_n^{(1)} = \\sum_{m \\neq n} \\frac{\\langle \\psi_m^{(0)} | H' | \\psi_n^{(0)} \\rangle}{E_n^{(0)} - E_m^{(0)}} \\psi_m^{(0)}\\]    with \\(\\psi_n^{(0)}\\) expressed as a linear combination of the degenerate states.   Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory is an essential tool in quantum mechanics used to study systems under the influence of a time-varying external force or potential. It provides a way to calculate the probabilities of transitions between different quantum states over time. Basic Concept Consider a quantum system described by a time-independent Hamiltonian \\(\\hat{H}_0\\) with known eigenstates $ \\ket{n} $ and corresponding energies \\(E_n\\): \\[\\hat{H}_0 \\ket{n} = E_n \\ket{n}\\]When a time-dependent perturbation \\(\\hat{V}(t)\\) is applied to the system, the total Hamiltonian becomes: \\[\\hat{H}(t) = \\hat{H}_0 + \\hat{V}(t)\\]The perturbation \\(\\hat{V}(t)\\) is assumed to be small, so it induces transitions between the eigenstates of \\(\\hat{H}_0\\). Perturbation Expansion The state of the system \\(\\ket{\\Psi(t)}\\) evolves according to the Schrödinger equation: \\[i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\ket{\\Psi(t)} = \\hat{H}(t) \\ket{\\Psi(t)}\\]We express the state \\(\\ket{\\Psi(t)}\\) as a superposition of the unperturbed eigenstates: \\[\\ket{\\Psi(t)}= \\sum_n c_n(t) e^{-iE_n t/\\hbar}\\ket{n}\\]Here, \\(c_n(t)\\) are the time-dependent coefficients that give the probability amplitude for the system to be in state \\(\\ket{n}\\) at time \\(t\\). First-Order Approximation In the first-order approximation, the change in the coefficients \\(c_n(t)\\) is given by: \\[c_n^{(1)}(t) = -\\frac{i}{\\hbar} \\int_{t_0}^{t} \\langle n|\\hat{V}(t')|\\Psi(t')\\rangle e^{iE_n t'/\\hbar} dt'\\]If the system starts in state \\(\\ket{m}\\) at \\(t_0\\), we have: \\[c_n^{(1)}(t) = -\\frac{i}{\\hbar} \\int_{t_0}^{t} \\bra{n}\\hat{V}(t')\\ket{m} e^{i(E_n-E_m)t'/\\hbar} dt'\\]This integral allows us to calculate the probability of the system transitioning from state \\(\\ket{m}\\) to state \\(\\ket{n}\\) due to the perturbation. Transition Probability The probability of the system being found in state \\(\\ket{n}\\) at time \\(t\\) is given by \\(P_{m \\to n}(t)\\): \\[P_{m \\to n}(t) = |c_n^{(1)}(t)|^2\\]For a sinusoidal perturbation of the form \\(\\hat{V}(t) = \\hat{V}_0 \\cos(\\omega t)\\), this expression can be further simplified, leading to well-known results such as Fermi’s Golden Rule for transition rates. Sudden Perturbation In exploring time-dependent perturbation theory, we consider the case of fast or “sudden” perturbations. A perturbation is deemed sudden if the transition from one time-independent Hamiltonian \\(\\hat{H}_0\\) to another \\(\\hat{H}'_0\\) occurs over a time much shorter than any natural period of the system. In such cases, perturbation theory becomes irrelevant. If the system is initially in an eigenstate \\(\\ket{n}\\) of \\(\\hat{H}_0\\), its time evolution post-transition follows \\(\\hat{H}'_0\\). The initial state can then be expressed as a sum over the eigenstates of \\(\\hat{H}'_0\\): \\[\\ket{n} = \\sum_{n'} \\ket{n'} \\bra{n'} n \\rangle\\]The key challenge is to ensure that the change is sudden enough, which is determined by estimating the actual time taken for the Hamiltonian to change and the periods of motion associated with the state \\(\\ket{n}\\) and its transitions to neighboring states. Harmonic Perturbations: Fermi’s Golden Rule Consider a system prepared in an initial state \\(\\ket{i}\\) that is perturbed by a periodic harmonic potential \\(V(t) = V e^{-i\\omega t}\\), which is abruptly switched on at \\(t = 0\\). This scenario could represent an atom perturbed by an external oscillating electric field, like an incident light wave. We aim to determine the probability that at some later time \\(t\\), the system is found in state \\(\\ket{f}\\). From first-order perturbation theory, the coefficient \\(c^{(1)}_f(t)\\) is given by: \\[c^{(1)}_f(t) = -\\frac{i}{\\hbar} \\int_{0}^{t} dt' \\bra{f} V \\ket{i} e^{i(\\omega_{fi} - \\omega)t'} = -\\frac{i}{\\hbar} \\bra{f} V \\ket{i} \\frac{e^{i(\\omega_{fi} - \\omega)t} - 1}{i(\\omega_{fi} - \\omega)}\\]The probability of the transition after time \\(t\\) is then: \\[P_{i \\to f}(t) = \\left| c^{(1)}_f(t) \\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} \\left| \\bra{f} V \\ket{i} \\right|^2 \\left( \\frac{\\sin((\\omega_{fi} - \\omega)t/2)}{(\\omega_{fi} - \\omega)/2} \\right)^2\\]By setting \\(\\alpha = (\\omega_{fi} - \\omega)/2\\), the probability becomes: \\[P_{i \\to f}(t) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} \\left| \\bra{f} V \\ket{i} \\right|^2 \\frac{\\sin^2(\\alpha t)}{\\alpha^2}\\]As \\(t\\) approaches infinity, the function asymptotes to a delta function \\(\\pi t \\delta(\\alpha)\\) as shown in figure below, indicating that the likelihood of transition is proportional to the time elapsed. To obtain the transition rate, we divide by \\(t\\): \\[\\boxed{R_{i \\to f}(t) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{P_{i \\to f}(t)}{t} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar^2} \\left| \\bra{f} V \\ket{i} \\right|^2 \\delta(\\omega_{fi} - \\omega)}\\]This result is known as Fermi’s Golden Rule. Although named after Enrico Fermi, much of the foundational work was done by P.A.M. Dirac in an earlier study, who formulated a nearly identical equation involving a constant, the matrix element of the perturbation, and an energy difference.     ","categories": ["lecture"],

        "excerpt":"In the hydrogen atom, the energy levels are determined by the principal quantum number \\(n\\), and for a given \\(n\\), the energy is given by: \\[E_n^{(0)} = -\\frac{13.6 \\, \\text{eV}}{n^2}\\]For \\(n = 2\\), the energy level is: \\[E_2^{(0)} = -\\frac{13.6 \\, \\text{eV}}{4} = -3.4 \\, \\text{eV}\\]This level is four-fold degenerate because there are multiple quantum states with the same energy. The states are specified by the quantum numbers \\(n\\), \\(l\\), and \\(m_l\\), where:   \\(n\\) is the principal quantum number,  \\(l\\) is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, which can take values from \\(0\\) to \\(n-1\\),  \\(m_l\\) is the magnetic quantum number, which can take values from \\(-l\\) to \\(l\\).For \\(n = 2.\\)  \\(l\\) can be \\(0\\) (s-orbital) or \\(1\\) (p-orbital):   For \\(l = 0\\), \\(m_l = 0\\).  For \\(l = 1\\), \\(m_l = -1, 0, 1\\).Thus, the ( n = 2 ) level has the following four degenerate states:   $ \\ket{2,0,0}$ (2s state)  $ \\ket{2,1,0}$ (2p state)  $ \\ket{2,1,1}$ (2p state)  $ \\ket{2,1,-1}$ (2p state)These states are degenerate in the absence of an external electric field. In presence of electric field they split as shown in figure given below:  Perturbation: The Stark Effect When an external electric field \\(\\mathcal{E}\\) is applied along the \\(z\\)-axis, the Hamiltonian is perturbed: \\[H = H_0 + \\lambda H'\\]where \\(H_0\\) is the unperturbed Hamiltonian, \\(\\lambda\\) is a small parameter, and \\(H'\\) is the perturbation due to the electric field. The perturbation Hamiltonian \\(H'\\) is: \\[H' = e\\mathcal{E}z\\]In spherical coordinates, \\(z = r\\cos\\theta\\), so: \\[H' = e\\mathcal{E}r\\cos\\theta\\]The task is to find the first-order corrections to the energy levels and eigenfunctions due to this perturbation. Matrix Elements of the Perturbation To find the corrections, we need to calculate the matrix elements of \\(H'\\) in the subspace of the degenerate states. The degenerate states for \\(n = 2\\) are: \\[\\psi_{200}^{(0)}, \\, \\psi_{211}^{(0)}, \\, \\psi_{210}^{(0)}, \\, \\psi_{21-1}^{(0)}\\]where:   \\(\\psi_{200}^{(0)}\\) is the 2s state.  \\(\\psi_{211}^{(0)}\\), \\(\\psi_{210}^{(0)}\\), \\(\\psi_{21-1}^{(0)}\\) are the 2p states.The matrix elements $H’_{ij} = \\brakett{\\psi_i^{(0)}}{H’}{\\psi_j^{(0)}}$ are:   \\[H'_{11} = \\brakett{\\psi_{200}^{(0)}}{e\\mathcal{E}z}{\\psi_{200}^{(0)}} = 0\\;\\text{(due to parity)}\\]    \\[H'_{12} = \\brakett{\\psi_{200}^{(0)}}{e\\mathcal{E}z}{\\psi_{211}^{(0)}}\\]    \\[H'_{13} = \\brakett{\\psi_{200}^{(0)}}{e\\mathcal{E}z}{\\psi_{210}^{(0)}}\\]    \\[H'_{14} = \\brakett{\\psi_{200}^{(0)}}{e\\mathcal{E}z}{\\psi_{21-1}^{(0)}}\\]    \\[H'_{22} = \\brakett{\\psi_{211}^{(0)}}{e\\mathcal{E}z}{\\psi_{211}^{(0)}}\\]    \\[H'_{33} = \\brakett{\\psi_{210}^{(0)}}{e\\mathcal{E}z}{\\psi_{210}^{(0)}}\\]    \\[H'_{44} = \\brakett{\\psi_{21-1}^{(0)}}{e\\mathcal{E}z}{\\psi_{21-1}^{(0)}}\\]  These elements need to be calculated. For simplicity, we consider the known spherical harmonics and radial functions. Calculating Matrix Elements The matrix elements for the 2s and 2p states involve the radial part \\(R_{nl}\\) and the angular part \\(Y_{lm}\\). For \\(n = 2\\):   Radial Part:          \\(R_{20}(r)\\) for 2s state      \\(R_{21}(r)\\) for 2p states        Angular Part:          \\(Y_{00}\\) for \\(l = 0, m = 0\\)      \\(Y_{1m}\\) for \\(l = 1, m = -1, 0, 1\\)      For the Stark effect, the relevant spherical harmonics are: \\[Y_1^0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4\\pi}} \\cos\\theta\\]\\[Y_1^{\\pm1} = \\mp\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{8\\pi}} \\sin\\theta e^{\\pm i\\phi}\\]Non-Zero Matrix Elements Using these, we find the non-zero matrix elements: \\[H'_{13} = \\langle \\psi_{200}^{(0)} | e\\mathcal{E}z | \\psi_{210}^{(0)} \\rangle = e\\mathcal{E} \\langle 200 | r\\cos\\theta | 210 \\rangle\\]The radial part can be computed as: \\[\\int_0^\\infty r^3 R_{20} R_{21} \\, dr\\]And the angular part: \\[\\int Y_{00} \\cos\\theta Y_{10} \\, d\\Omega\\]Combining these gives: \\[H'_{13} = e\\mathcal{E} \\left( \\frac{3a_0}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4\\pi}} \\int_0^\\infty r^3 R_{20} R_{21} \\, dr\\]Solving the Secular Equation We construct the perturbation matrix \\(H'\\) in the subspace of the \\(n = 2\\) states and solve the secular equation: \\[\\begin{vmatrix}H'_{11} - E^{(1)} &amp; H'_{12} &amp; H'_{13} &amp; H'_{14} \\\\H'_{21} &amp; H'_{22} - E^{(1)} &amp; H'_{23} &amp; H'_{24} \\\\H'_{31} &amp; H'_{32} &amp; H'_{33} - E^{(1)} &amp; H'_{34} \\\\H'_{41} &amp; H'_{42} &amp; H'_{43} &amp; H'_{44} - E^{(1)}\\end{vmatrix} = 0\\]Since only \\(H'_{13}=\\;H'_{31}=-3e \\mathcal{E} a_0\\) term is non-zero therefore we have \\[\\begin{vmatrix} - E^{(1)} &amp; 0 &amp; -3e \\mathcal{E} a_0 &amp; 0 \\\\0 &amp;  - E^{(1)} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\-3e \\mathcal{E} a_0 &amp; 0 &amp;  - E^{(1)} &amp; 0 \\\\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp;  - E^{(1)}\\end{vmatrix} = 0\\]where \\(a_0\\) is the Bohr radius. Given the symmetry and properties of the hydrogen atom, we find that the first-order energy corrections \\(E_{2,m}^{(1)}\\) are: \\[E_{2,m}^{(1)} = \\pm 3e \\mathcal{E} a_0\\]Conclusion An external electric field lifts the degeneracy of the \\(n = 2\\) level in the hydrogen atom, splitting it into distinct energy levels.

        "excerpt":" Rate Equations for a Three-Level Laser System A three-level laser system operates using the principle of stimulated emission of radiation. The rate equations describe how the populations of various energy levels change under the influence of pumping and laser radiation. The goal is to achieve population inversion, which is necessary for laser action. The Three-Level System In a three-level laser system, atoms or molecules transition between three distinct energy levels:   Ground State (Level 1, $E_1$): The initial state with the population $N_1$.  Excited State (Level 3, $E_3$): The state to which atoms are pumped from the ground state, with the population $N_3$.  Metastable State (Level 2, $E_2$): A relatively stable excited state where population inversion occurs, with the population $N_2$.  Pumping Transition (1 → 3): Atoms are pumped from the ground state (1) to the excited state (3).  Lasing Transition (2 → 1): Atoms transition from the metastable state (2) to the ground state (1), emitting laser radiation.  Rapid Decay (3 → 2): Atoms in state (3) quickly decay to state (2) through nonradiative processes.Rate Equations Let $N_1$, $N_2$, and $N_3$ be the populations of levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The total number of atoms per unit volume is: $N = N_1 + N_2 + N_3$   Population Rate of Level 3 (Excited State):$\\frac{dN_3}{dt} = W_p (N_1 - N_3) - N_3 T_{32}$   $W_p N_1$ represents the rate of induced absorption for the 1 → 3 transition.  $W_p N_3$ represents the rate of stimulated emission for the 3 → 1 transition.  $T_{32} = A_{32} + S_{32}$ is the total relaxation rate from level 3 to level 2, where:          $A_{32}$ is the Einstein A coefficient for spontaneous emission.      $S_{32}$ is the nonradiative transition rate.        Population Rate of Level 2 (Metastable State):$\\frac{dN_2}{dt} = W_l (N_1 - N_2) + N_3 T_{32} - N_2 T_{21}$   $W_l (N_1 - N_2)$ represents the stimulated transitions between levels 1 and 2 (2 → 1 lasing).  $N_3 T_{32}$ represents the spontaneous transitions from level 3 to level 2.  $N_2 T_{21}$ represents the spontaneous transitions from level 2 to level 1.  $W_l$ is proportional to the Einstein B coefficient $B_{21}$ and the energy density of the lasing transition.  $T_{21} \\approx A_{21}$ represents the spontaneous relaxation rate from level 2 to level 1.  Population Rate of Level 1 (Ground State):$\\frac{dN_1}{dt} = W_p (N_3 - N_1) + W_l (N_2 - N_1) + N_2 T_{21}$   $W_p (N_3 - N_1)$ represents the net stimulated transitions between levels 1 and 3.  $W_l (N_2 - N_1)$ represents the stimulated transitions between levels 1 and 2.  $N_2 T_{21}$ represents the spontaneous transitions from level 2 to level 1.  Conservation of Population:$\\frac{dN_1}{dt} + \\frac{dN_2}{dt} + \\frac{dN_3}{dt} = 0$ Equations (2), (4), and (5) are referred to as the rate equations for a three-level laser system. Steady-State Solutions At steady state, the time derivatives of the populations are zero: $\\frac{dN_1}{dt} = 0, \\quad \\frac{dN_2}{dt} = 0, \\quad \\frac{dN_3}{dt} = 0$   For Level 3:$N_3 = \\frac{W_p}{W_p + T_{32}} N_1$   For Level 2:$N_2 = \\frac{W_l + \\frac{T_{32} W_p}{W_p + T_{32}}}{W_l + T_{21}} N_1$   Population Difference Between Levels 2 and 1:$\\frac{N_2 - N_1}{N} = \\frac{W_p (T_{32} - T_{21}) - T_{32} T_{21}}{3W_p W_l + 2W_p T_{21} + 2T_{32} W_l + T_{32} W_p + T_{32} T_{21}}$ Condition for Population Inversion To achieve population inversion between levels 2 and 1 ($N_2 &gt; N_1$), a necessary condition is: $T_{32} &gt; T_{21}$   The relaxation rate from level 3 to level 2 must be greater than that from level 2 to level 1.  The lifetime of level 3 must be shorter than that of level 2.Minimum Pumping Rate for Population Inversion A minimum pumping rate $W_p$ is required to maintain population inversion: $W_{p,\\text{min}} = \\frac{T_{32} T_{21}}{T_{32} - T_{21}}$ For population inversion to occur, the actual pumping rate $W_p$ must be greater than $W_{p,\\text{min}}$.

Competitive Exam Questions - GATE, NET, JEST, etc.       The semi-empirical mass formula for the binding energy of nucleus contains a surfacecorrection term.

Weak Nuclear Force:          Responsible for beta decay, where a neutron transforms into a proton, emitting an electron and a neutrino.      The weak force is weaker than the strong force, which is why beta decay is common but requires much less energy than breaking the strong force to split the nucleus.      Yukawa’s Meson Hypothesis In 1935, Hideki Yukawa proposed the existence of a new particle to mediate the strong nuclear force, similar to how photons mediate the electromagnetic force. This particle, later identified as the pion (π-meson), would account for the short-range nature of the nuclear force binding protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus. Yukawa’s hypothesis revolutionized our understanding of nuclear interactions and provided a foundational step in particle physics. Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and Particle Mass Estimation Yukawa’s approach involved utilizing the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states: $\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\approx \\hbar$ where $\\Delta E$ is the energy uncertainty, $\\Delta t$ is the time interval over which this uncertainty applies, and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck’s constant. The energy-time uncertainty relationship suggests that a particle can temporarily “borrow” energy $\\Delta E$ for a brief period $\\Delta t$, creating a “virtual particle” that mediates interactions over short distances. For a particle moving at nearly the speed of light, the time $\\Delta t$ can be estimated based on the range of the strong nuclear force, roughly 1 fermi ($1 \\ \\text{fm} = 10^{-15} \\ \\text{m}$). Problem Statement Given the range of the strong nuclear force as approximately 1 fermi ($10^{-15} \\ \\text{m}$), calculate the approximate mass of the pion assuming it moves at nearly the speed of light. Solution: Using the steps outlined below, calculate $\\Delta t$, then find $\\Delta E$ using the uncertainty principle, and finally convert this energy into the mass of the pion. Calculation of the Pion Mass To estimate the mass of the pion that carries the strong nuclear force, we can use the uncertainty principle and consider the approximate range of nuclear forces:       Step 1: Determine $\\Delta t$     Since the pion mediates the strong force over a distance $r \\approx 1 \\ \\text{fm}$, we approximate $\\Delta t$ as:     $\\Delta t \\approx \\frac{r}{c}$     where $c$ is the speed of light.         Step 2: Calculate $\\Delta E$     By the uncertainty principle, we have:     $\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{\\hbar c}{r}$         Step 3: Find the Mass of the Pion     This energy $\\Delta E$ corresponds to the mass of the pion (or meson) using Einstein’s equation $E = mc^2$:     $m_\\pi \\approx \\frac{\\Delta E}{c^2} = \\frac{\\hbar}{r c}$   Substituting known values ($\\hbar c \\approx 197 \\ \\text{MeV fm}$, $r \\approx 1 \\ \\text{fm}$): $m_\\pi \\approx \\frac{197 \\ \\text{MeV fm}}{1 \\ \\text{fm} \\cdot c} \\approx 197 \\ \\text{MeV}/c^2$ Thus, Yukawa predicted the mass of the pion to be approximately 200 times the mass of the electron, which aligns with the observed pion mass in nature.
